In this series we cut out the jargon and let the politicians loose, but only for the floors of Bowen House. The leaders are limited to the length of an elevator ride to pitch their party. In today's Elevator Pitch, ACT leader David Seymour says he doesn't support splashing the cash, and crushes on a Scooby Snack-loving cartoon. In this episode Seymour pitches to Charlotte Cook why his party should get people's vote. ACT leader David Seymour said it's a party for the self-starters and the independent thinkers. "If you wanna see a group of thoughtful, independent minded MPs sitting in Parliament holding everyone accountable, that's a reason you might give your party vote to ACT." Seymour said the party is principled and gets things done when it really counts. It's focused on reducing debt for future generations, he said. "We are not going to support splashing the cash in every conceivable direction." Seymour also reveals his cartoon crush "Ruh-roh--RAGGY" and meets a pal in the lift. In previous episodes, National Party leader Judith Collins has tried to pinch a member from another party, and NZ First leader Winston Peters and Green Party leader James Shaw found themselves in a different kind of competition. The Elevator Pitch is a five-part series where leaders of the main parties pitch why someone should vote for them in the time it takes to ride the elevator.

Winston Peters. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers Details of hundreds of New Zealanders - politicians, judges, business leaders, journalists and even criminals - have been collected by Chinese company Zhenhua, which has been linked to the country's military and intelligence. Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said it would be "naive" to think there was no connection with the Chinese state. "The part that is of concern is, what is the purpose in this case of this collection of data. I know why big businesses do it - it is to shape their market it is to look at influencers and all sorts of things. "In this case, I think people would be asking why is a country doing it, and what is its ultimate purpose." "If you look at the big picture, and put aside the players here, of course it has an influence on national security. "And of course it will reflect on those who are most susceptible, naive or otherwise, to selling the interests of the country down the drain. "That's what it's always been about." Peters said the nature of the system was that every company in China had a Communist Party interest in it. Asked if the data collection was being done at behest of Chinese state, Peters said it was "naive to think otherwise". "There is not a level of disconnect or independence between the two systems. No-one makes a step of this sort unless it is sanctioned by Beijing." This also happened in other countries, and with big business, he said. "It is very disquieting in the extreme that the collection of information is being sought, not for what you might call a marketing purpose or to sell product, but the purpose is perhaps to find information that can be used in a future time to persuade a certain outcome from individuals associated with the person that has been the source of the information collection." The Security Intelligence Service (SIS) is reviewing the data leak for any potential risks and security concerns, but director Rebecca Kitteridge said it seemed the information collected had primarily been drawn from the public domain. Kitteridge said the leak was a timely reminder for people to check their security settings and consider the amount of information they share on the internet. Peters echoed the message. "People should be warned when they go online and engage in social media and divulge their personal information it can be used or misused against them or people close to them or contacts they might have," he said. "If you look at some of the international events where actors have been involved in manipulating political outcomes, and manipulating a stance a country might take with respect to another one, they are very, very serious." Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the data leak, which includes the names of her mother, father and sister, highlighted the need for vigilance on cybersecurity. She was reluctant to comment on security matters however. Technology commentator Paul Brislen said the data collection was more like "business as usual" in "building a dossier on people you might want to talk to or engage with at some point, using publicly available sources".

Instead, they had to settle for a sympathetic ear, yet more apologies and a vague assurance that the funding will be turned into a commercial loan. Marama Davidson and James Shaw at Normanby School South Taranaki. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin The Green Party co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson went back to school yesterday to make good on a promise to listen to the teachers, many of who are angry about the Green School debacle and the contrast with other school communities putting up with shonky school infrastructure. The Green Party top brass travelled around Taranaki visiting schools in Stratford, Normanby and punake before fronting a meeting in New Plymouth. The Green School, south of New Plymouth. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin The principal of Turuturu School in Hwera, Richard Bradley, met them at Normanby. He said discussion was wide-ranging. "We've been asking him a lot of questions about the Greens' education policy, and we've been concerned around property funding, which seems to dominate more than it should, but then we were also really interested in teacher supply. "Teacher supply in Taranaki and across the country is a big issue for just about every school." But the Green School was the elephant in the room. Turuturu School principal Richard Bradley. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin "Taranaki, New Zealand schools ... many, many, many schools are underfunded. They don't have great property, they have holes in their roofs, their carpet is a bit messy, and then when a school like the Green School still gets all this money all it can do is cause concern. It's unjust and unfair." Bradley said James Shaw offered his by-now familiar apology for the "error in judgement", adding that if he had his time again he'd make a different decision. Ahead of the New Plymouth meeting, the expectations of Taranaki Secondary Schools Principals' Association chair Martin Chamberlain were clear. "We're hoping bottomline for a retraction. I know the machinery of government is complicated but anything else is much much less than ideal." But he didn't get what he wanted. "Ah, no. We found out that technically that was impossible. Government machinery doesn't have a reverse gear, so this offer was made to the Green School in good faith and that can't be withdrawn. "But what we do know is that it's gone to Treasury at another level now, and it's being decided on whether it's a complete grant or a complete loan, or a mixture of both." Taranaki Secondary Schools Principals' Association chair Martin Chamberlain. Photo: RNZ/ Robin Martin Chamberlain, who said the meeting was conciliatory in nature, thought the grant should be converted into a full loan at market interest rates. The Green School has said most of the money was meant to be in the form of loans. If not anger, James Shaw said he could certainly sense tension during the meetings. "It was more sort of frustrated, you know after years ... and kinda disappointed. And really looking for: how do we try and make sure we do actually upgrade and restore and replenish our school estate around the country?" He thought his apology went down well. "Look, they really appreciated it. One of the things one of them said was is that obviously politicians make mistakes all the time but they don't often apologise for it, so I think that was appreciated." Negotiations are ongoing between Crown Infrastructure Partners and the Green School to decide what shape the funding will eventually take.

Photo: moodboard/123RF The Tick for Kids coalition surveyed the main parties about a range of policy areas that impact children, including education, health, welfare and housing. It received responses from Labour, the Greens, New Zealand First, the Mori Party and TOP. National did not respond and the ACT Party opted to skip all of the questions. Coalition convenor Jacqui Southey said there was a lot of agreement about cleaning up waterways, upgrading state houses and building cycleways. But she said more needs to be done to lift families out of poverty. "We know that housing is having a significant impact on families right now in New Zealand and is responsible for increasing the numbers of children living in poverty, by around 40 percent," Southey said. They also called for a significant increase to benefits, so families can cover their basic costs. "We know that there's been a $25 welfare increase; in the big scheme of things $25 does not really go a long way in total for a family to meet their costs, particularly when rental costs are incredibly high." Southey hoped that any parties pitching taxes changes targeting the wealthy would spend that revenue supporting those on lower incomes, as well as health and education services. She also wanted to see more support for people who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, particularly women and mothers of young children. Southey said expanding the Coalition Government's Best Start payments for families with a new baby could be one way to do that. "It could be a really good way of putting some more money in the pockets of families that need it most." The Tick for Kids coalition is backed by 39 other social organisations, including Plunket, Unicef, College of Public Health Medicine, Paediatric Society, Principals' Federation, Amnesty International Aotearoa and IHC.

Transport Minister Phil Twyford said the Government Policy Statement on land transport builds on its transport policy. Photo: RNZ / Richard Tindiller The Government Policy Statement on land transport (GPS) 2021 priorities include safety, better transport options, improving freight connections and climate change. It was also confirmed that the government will not raise petrol taxes or road user charges during the 2021-2023 period. Transport Minister Phil Twyford said the focus is jobs. "The GPS is on top of 'shovel ready' transport projects and those being built through the NZ Upgrade Programme and Provincial Growth Fund - together they will create and support thousands of jobs." The GPS built on the government's transport policy, Twyford said. Feedback on the draft GPS had prompted the government to increase funding for state highway maintenance by $510 million. Rail was also getting an extra $500m to "keep the network on track, which will help us reduce emissions, accidents and the costs of road maintenance by shifting more freight to rail," Twyford said. Twyford's foreword on the GPS describes it as "our roadmap for how the government develops and maintains a transport network that keeps pace with future social and economic changes". "It puts forward strategic priorities and investment principles that are informed by urban spatial economics to ensure our land transport system is economically and environmentally sustainable." GPS is how the government guides Waka Kotahi New Zealand Transport Agency to invest more than $4.5b a year raised through the National Land Transport Fund over the period of 2021/22 - 2030/31. Money for the National Land Transport Fund Revenue is collected from fuel excise duty, road user charges, vehicle and driver registration and licensing, state highway property disposal and leasing and road tolling. The government's Road to Zero strategy will get $10b over the next decade. Twyford said safety remained the government's top priority, with an aim to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the road by 40 percent. "That means on average $1 billion a year being spent on better resourcing the police on our roads, safety infrastructure like median barriers, and public safety campaigns," he said. "We're making good progress addressing the infrastructure deficit we inherited with the revenue from GPS 2018, so I am confirming the government will not raise petrol taxes and road user charges during 2021-23."
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426223/winston-peters-finds-his-mojo-on-the-campaign-trail|2020-09-16|Analysis - Back in his old stomping ground Winston Peters finally sprang to life today. Winston Peters hitting his stride at an election campaign event in Tauranga. Photo: RNZ/ Simon Rogers After a slow and lacklustre slog through the South Island on his nationwide 'Back Your Future' bus tour last week, things could only improve for the 75-year-old seasoned politician. This campaign is hard work for all MPs but Peters has appeared to struggle more than most, unable to rely on his bread-and-butter packed town hall meetings and not quite mastering the walkabout. While it wasn't a hall he found himself in on Wednesday in Tauranga - the electorate he first won in 1984 - it was a sizeable and socially-distanced gathering of about 100 outdoors in the Red Square. And it was complete with his favourite - hecklers. There was the woman with bright red hair carrying a Family First placard with Jacinda Ardern's face on it saying unborn babies are people too. She had a particularly yappy dog in tow and after a series of interruptions Peters asked her to get rid of it, to no avail. Then there was the woman who challenged him for not wearing a mask. Winston Peters talked to a sizeable and socially distance crowd of about 100 in the Red Square in Tauranga. Photo: RNZ/ Simon Rogers Peters decided she was a Mori Party supporter and a Covid-19 denier and told her to leave - eventually she did. The gathered crowd - some clear supporters, others just passing by and a few just keen to see Peters in the flesh - were attentive and laughed at his jokes. It was classic Peters in full flight. The media got a serve more than once, as did Labour and the Greens. Winston Peters in Rotorua today, he's changed plans and will continue to focus on the provinces until Auckland's Covid restrictions ease. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers National and ACT supporters got told to go find an abacus if they thought the math would ever add up to the two parties being in power after 17 October. And to round things off those gathered were told not once, not twice, but three times to "take out some insurance" and back New Zealand First. If those in the crowd had, like the media who have spent years following him, heard the one-liners before, they did a good job of not letting on. In fact they lapped it up. With a Serious Fraud Office investigation casting a shadow over the New Zealand First campaign, at times over the last fortnight it has felt like Peters was just going through the motions. Peters seems to have worked out how "to actually talk to people in this strange Covid-19 campaign world". Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers But he's found his mojo again. In Tauranga and Rotorua he was almost mobbed by pensioners keen to thank him for their SuperGold card benefits. Peters had planned to head to Auckland at the end of this week but with such heavy restrictions still in place in the country's largest city it's simply not conducive to his campaign style. Instead he will continue to focus on the provinces and head to the super city when the level 2 rules ease. Many have already written Peters off, but he's only two weeks into a six week campaign and he's certainly put the long hours in from one end of the country to the other. But more importantly, he's finally worked out how to actually talk to people in this strange Covid-19 campaign world. Turns out you really can teach an old dog new tricks.

Mori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said there are not enough options for young people leaving school and not going into tertiary education to get a well-paying job. Photo: Supplied In its newly-released education policy, the Mori Party has called for an "overhaul" of the mainstream education system and for equitable funding for khanga reo, kura kaupapa and wharekura. "Fundamental change is required to ensure that Mori can fulfil their potential," Mori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said. "No one can realise their aspirations unless they know who they are, where they come from, and are proud of their culture and heritage." Ngarewa-Packer said their policy would ensure the majority of Mori children who are enrolled at mainstream schools would be supported to overcome inequity, racism and the digital divide. This would be achieved by giving free digital devices and free internet access to all students from Year 4 - Year 13, ensuring all schools have Mori in senior leadership teams, and funding schools to hire additional Mori support staff. For kaupapa Mori education, the party would establish a $200 million fund for a new hapu-based wnanga, and to drive whnau, hap and iwi education initiatives. It would also address Te Khanga Reo claim (WAI 2336) by "significantly" increasing operational funding for recognising the teaching qualification, Whakapakari Tino Rangatiratanga as being equal to that of other mainstream Early Childhood Centre qualifications and guaranteeing pay equity for kaiako at khanga reo. It would also increase and promote scholarships for reo Mori speakers to train as teachers, and in Te Aho Matua, the kura kaupapa framework. The party also wants to set up a $276m fund to increase investment in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) academies, such as Phoro STEM Academy, and to double the existing Mori and Pacific trade training and cadetship placements. Ngarewa-Packer said there are not enough options for young people leaving school and not going into tertiary education to get a well-paying job.

New Zealand First leader Winston Peters at a campaign event in Tauranga. Photo: RNZ/ Simon Rogers New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said the new marine biology facility would enable scientific research that would benefit the country. "This will allow us to learn, grow and develop skills that create opportunities to add value to exports," Peters said. The announcement follows a pledge by the party last week to provide $100 million to Aquacorp to support off-shore marine farming. This money would come from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund or the Provincial Growth Fund. "Aquaculture has demonstrated immense potential and we need to back it with the science and people too," said Peters. "The science and innovation with seaweed as an agri-feed to reduce carbon emissions or used as a biofuel or fertilizer is being worked on and is critical for this sector to grow and develop." The government's Provincial Growth Fund has invested $37.9m into aquaculture over the past three years. The industry made $600m in annual sales in 2018 and provided more than 3000 jobs, Peters said. This could grow to $3 billion by 2035 with innovations to maximise value through products such as premium salmon and mussel oils and powders, extending land-based hatcheries, and expanding aquaculture in the sea with open-ocean farming, he said. "New Zealand First Policy is for the Crown to underwrite the expansion into deep sea aquaculture of offshore marine farming in collaboration with other stakeholders. "It will ensure that off-shore marine growing areas are not privatized for the benefit exclusively of private or foreign investors. "This will ensure that the Crown gets a return on behalf of the public for commercial use of this marine open space," Peters said.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018764296/finance-minister-on-plans-to-reduce-debt-maintain-services|2020-09-16|The Finance Minister says he's got a balanced plan to reduce debt and keep services going, despite concerning unemployment forecasts. Thegovernment's books have been openedahead of the election today... and they show a bleak outlook, with unemployment set to rise to 7.8 percent in the first quarter of next year, while GDP continues to shrink. Grant Robertson told RNZ he's not gilding the lily, and there will be tough times ahead for New Zealanders. He told Checkpoint that with all the uncertainty it's unrealistic to make any promises of where the country's debt rate should be. "At the moment, in the conditions we're in, making those kinds of promises isn't actually responsible; what I know is that over my time as Finance Minister I've shown that I have been disciplined, we've reduced debt to under 20 percent. I remain committed to keeping debt under control. "But given where we are in this pandemic, what we can best do is set the pathway that we have and work together to keep debt under control and keep those public services. More will emerge over time as we get clearer on how the pandemic affects the economy globally, but we will have higher levels of debt and a deficit for some time to come, and I have been saying that since March of this year." As of tomorrow, the country will officially be in recession (two consecutive quarters where the economy declines). So what more can Robertson and Labour do in this next term to correct that - given they'vepromised not to hike income taxesexcept for the already- announced top 2 percent of earners? "We've already got a programme we've outlined of a massive investment in infrastructure to build more houses, to be able to create jobs right across the economy, we're going to be supporting people into work through the extension of the flexi-wage programme," Robertson says. "We're also supporting small businesses to be able to thrive and move online, we've got a host of programmes that are about that. "But then we're also looking to the future with industry transformation plans. We're in there now with the agricultural sector, working on an agri-tech strategy that will lift the value of the wages in that sector. We've got a similar one in construction, and in the digital area. "We have to lift our productivity, we need to be more sustainable, that's why we're heading towards a 100 percent renewable electricity strategy, and backing that up with investments in new technology, like the hydrogen economy which actually will lead to export earnings, and will lead to better jobs with higher wages. "All that's part of our five-point economic plan. The tax part of the equation is only ever part of the equation, and yes we are asking high income New Zealanders to pitch in a little bit more. When we put all of that together that is a steady path for New Zealand to sustainably grow the economy and manage debt. But when we're facing a one-in-one-hundred year economic shock there's no single silver bullet - anyone who's trying to sell you that isn't being realistic. I think today we've seen a pathway forward from here that is realistic." So, if Labour aren't relying on rising taxes for most, if re-elected, then what cuts will they make to keep spending low? In the weekend theyannounced the cut of future years of the fees free programme] for tertiary students... but what else will be on the chopping block? "There's a number of areas where we're going to have to be very careful with our spending, and fees free's an example. We also have already focused on another example - funding low income people to reduce the cost for them to go to the doctor, but not having the policy that we went to 2017 with: an overall reduction. "So we've been showing our willingness to do that, but actually it's about investment more than it is about cutting things. We need to strongly invest in the productive side of our economy and support those quality public services, because that's actually what enables us to come through this shock with new zealanders healthy, but also prosperous. "So yes, there'll be areas where we'll look to make sure our spending is of the highest possible quality, but actually investing in our people and retraining in our skills and investing in our business and industries will get us through this better than anything else." Labour set aide a $14.1 billion Covid-19 fund. But the catch is we don't know how much of that will be needed to fight the disease. So how much of that will be committed to funding the election promises Robertson is talking about? "For the vast bulk of that, it's there to be used if it is needed to help with Covid recovery, to deal with resurgences, like we've just seen. And we need to be careful about that - it will not be spent unless it is needed. "So we continue to be disciplined about that, but obviously the world does not know where the Covid journey ends. So that money remains available to us, but we will very carefully and judiciously use it in Covid-recovery." Has any of that $14.1 billion Covid-19 fund been allocated to election promises already? "A small amount yes, where it directly relates to Covid recovery," Robertson says. "Weannounced the Training Incentive Allowance policyat the weekend, which is about supporting people during a difficult period, who are out of work, to be able to get qualifications. And the extension of the Small Business Cashflow Scheme - which again is a direct Covid response. So there are some areas where we are committing it to elements of what our election policy is about. But the vast bulk of it remains on the table to deal with the future of Covid, which nobody can be certain about. Entrepreneur Nick Mowbray, of Zuru toys, hascalled for large corporates who got the government wage subsidy to pay it backif they're still turning a profit and paying dividends. What does Robertson think - should they do so? "They don't have to, because we set the scheme up in such a way that it was designed to give confidence and cashflow; it was designed to make sure that people weren't laid off. Obviously the criteria was that people had to stay employed, so it was about keeping that attachment between an employee and an employer. "Some businesses have decided to pay back because things didn't turn out the way they forecast they might. But for me it was far more important to get that money out, to give that confidence to ensure that people weren't laid off unnecessarily. I can't guarantee what a company would have done regardless of whether or not they're a wealthy company or they're now turning a profit. If people look into their own conscience and decide that's what they want to do that's a good thing, but they're still obeying the rules of the scheme if they don't do that." So, with no clawback over those companies who didn't need the subsidy to stay operational, was a catchall wage subsidy clever, given the cost adds to the national debt? "It was a no regrets approach," Robertson says; "I can't guarantee what those companies would have done, they may well have ended up laying people off regardless of whether they ended up turning a profit. "We wanted to protect New Zealanders' jobs, and 1.7 million New Zealanders' jobs have been protected through the wage subsidy scheme. "We wanted to deploy it quickly, and I think people appreciated that. So yep, with 2020 hindsight there's all sorts of things that we can say, but I remain very comfortable and proud of that scheme, because it did its job to keep New Zealanders in work."

Photo: RNZ Labour argues a balance is required between spending to boost the economy, managing the books responsibly, and without cutting key core services, and argues National's fiscal plan is caught in a "Bermuda triangle" that tries to do three conflicting things at once. Finance Minister Grant Robertson released today's pre-election economic and fiscal update showing a budget deficit of $23.4 billion for the year ended June, while the level of debt is marginally better at 27.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Robertson said government spending had cushioned the blow of a one-in-100 year shock, and the numbers showed New Zealand in better shape than expected. He also warned of tough times ahead however, acknowledging recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic would be tougher and take longer than was forecast in the Budget in May. While National said the figures showed the pain would be deeper under Labour, the Greens argue for more taxes for the wealthy, and ACT says the levels of debt being accrued under the current government will be impossible to escape. National Party leader Judith Collins says the update is "very dire reading". "We are looking at ... or are in the worst recession in living memory and it is one where the only answers we have from the current government is to tax more, to borrow more and to add more welfare," Collins says. National Party leader Judith Collins and Paul Goldsmith at a media briefing after the release of the prefu. Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson "Our plan, which will be released this week, will be all about growth, because no government ever taxed its way out of a recession." The last recession in the 1980s took years of hard work to recover from, she says. Staring down the barrel of 15 years of deficits to pay for Covid-19 means "it's not just our children who pay for this but also our grandchildren", Collins says. National's finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says the PREFU figures show the "pain will be longer and deeper under Labour and under the current settings". "In the short term, it's taking longer to come on, but in 2022, 2023 there will be more unemployment, so we're seeing a shrinking economy, another 100,000 New Zealanders losing their jobs over the next couple of years and deficits as far as the eye can see. "It underscores the absolute importance ... of having a focus on growth and getting New Zealand back in track." Collins says "wherever possible, any borrowing should be to create work, to actually build things ... rather to borrow and simply spend". Collins ruled out a repeat of Ruth Richardson's "mother of all budgets" following the recession in the late '80s. That budget saw major cuts to government spending, especially on welfare institutes and benefits. National finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson "I'd also say to you this: our government ... is going to be focused on growth and growth for the economy is utterly crucial, otherwise we will have more than 15 years of deficits, which the current government is looking at." Collins says having seen the books, she was assured that the National Party's "medicine" would work and be embraced by the public. "All of our spending promises have been costed and we are actually releasing our own fiscal update in a matter of days and you will see how we can do it." However, Robertson said National was caught in a "Bermuda triangle" style fiscal situation. Finance Minister Grant Robertson releases the pre-election economic and fiscal update at Parliament. Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson "They both want to increase spending, reduce revenue and dramatically reduce debt. You can't do all of those things at once credibly and I think their plan is lost somewhere in that triangle. "The reason why I am so against the idea of austerity-style cuts to achieve the kind of debt reductions I've seen from the National Party is I've seen the impact in New Zealand in previous downturns of that sort of approach. "That creates the intergenerational problems of children growing up in households where their parents aren't working, where they haven't got the incomes that they need." The Greens take credit for helping cushion the blow from Covid-19. Co-leader James Shaw says it is clear additional revenue raising measures will be needed, pointing to the party's policy of implementing a wealth tax for those with net worth over $1 million and new income tax brackets at $100,000 and $150,000 "As a partner in this government, the Greens have played an important role in developing policies like the wage subsidy," he says. The Green Party's James Shaw, flanked by his co-leader Marama Davidson Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone "The picture it paints is simple. When more people have work, they are not only able to provide for their families, but they also earn money that they spend in their local communities - which are the parts of the economy where most people earn their livelihood." Shaw says a wealth tax would help to rebalance the economy and ensure the wealthiest people in New Zealand, those who own property and shares, pay their fair share. "We all chip in taxes so we can have the country we want, including affordable healthcare, quality education, and accessible public transport. This is exactly what taxes are supposed to pay for, and why those who are benefitting the most should chip in a little more." ACT leader David Seymour says in the long-term, the debt levels from other parties are unsustainable and borders must reopen soon with tight regulations. He says the numbers show it is clear public debt, unemployment and economic growth will be worse once the economic-stimulus "sugar-hit" wears off. ACT Party leader David Seymour Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "The only thing that's got better is the next couple of quarters which is the sugar hit part of the game of two halves, once you get to the shutdown when that sugar hit wears off the forecasts have all deteriorated since May. "In my view the government of New Zealand has not performed at providing sound public health strategy and measures and as a result our ability to weather the storm is worse than it might otherwise be." He says every other party is in a spending race, but ACT is in "debt warning mode". "I think New Zealanders are looking at the money that's being borrowed and saying can we afford all these spending promises ... because actually the debt that's being piled up is going to be unaffordable." "What they want is a government that sets clear rules of the game so that businesses currently being driven bankrupt can remain open and they don't have to rely on wage subsidies for their employment - which is where too many people have been." He says he thinks tightly regulated immigration and tourism needs to restart immediately. "We've got to aspire to open the borders safely before the start of 2022. The rest of the world won't wait for us and a vaccine won't be here by then no matter how many people say they've got one." "We have high-end tourist operators in central Otago who would be very happy to follow tight rules and pay heavy penalties for breaching them if they could bring high-end tourists in and isolate them themselves in a remote area. "We're not able to do things like that because the whole modus operandi of this government is 'be grateful, don't aspire'." Announcing the update, Finance Minister Grant Robertson had said the 2022 date was an assumption by the Treasury, not government policy, and the government planned to open borders as soon as it was safely able to do so. Seymour says that is a good aspiration but not what the government has shown so far. "I think the government's strategy of spending up large with cheap borrowed money now is not a sustainable approach." He says the sustainable approach is to be smarter about public health and allow "real" activity to return. On debt, Robertson argues New Zealand is in a far better position that other economies, "The government met our target to lower net debt to 20 percent of GDP in both our first two budgets, putting us in a strong position to respond to Covid-19 and still maintain one of the lowest levels of debt in the OECD." He said the Treasury was anticipating a 16 percent decrease in GDP in the June 2020 quarter. "A historically large decline, but much smaller than the almost 24 percent forecast in the Budget update ... this is a global pandemic and it remains ongoing around the world. Many other advanced economies continue to struggle with heavily restricted economies and are having to manage large flare-ups of the virus. Our relative ongoing success in managing the virus still puts us at an advantage. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters used the update to strike a blow against Labour and the Green Party. Peters had a less rosy view, and said the update is the worst in New Zealand's history which should be a wake-up call for New Zealanders. "We've got a lot of soul searching to do" - Winston Peters Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers He said the next government would need to both grow the economy and live within its means, but parties on the left had made spending promises New Zealand could not afford. "The next government needs to have a stiff backbone to resist Labour and the Green parties' grandiose spending plans. "We've got a lot of soul searching to do ... it's no time for risks and wasteful spending. We need to be focused on turning our economy around now and those requirements mean that exports, running a smarter economy, the infrastructure ... and the Provincial Growth Fund are fundamental things to turn this economy around. It is no time for inexperienced and off-the-wall promises." Peters said there was nothing to compare the situation to, as nothing like this had happened before. He thought the unemployment figures were wrong. "Unless we can get people very quickly relocated into jobs or trained for jobs, then unemployment could rise higher than the 7.8 percent they've predicted by March 22. "These figures are predicated on what they know now. They're not predicated on the decisions being made by political parties right here in this campaign." "What you have got out today is based on the last quarter and you can be certain it is not getting better right now because we have just been through another lockdown... I think the circumstances are worse than people in the Treasury have thought and dare I say it, hither to the government message has thought." Unemployment could rise above 10 percent unless "we can change the psychology of a number of New Zealanders around in terms of being job ready and unless we can inject via sound tax policy, greater confidence into business", Peters said. He championed the PGF as a tool for tackling the predicted unemployment.

Security Intelligence Service director Rebecca Kitteridge Photo: RNZ / Diego Opatowski The dataset leaked from Zhenhua Data is said to contain personal details of 2.5 million people around the world, including politicians, their family members, judges, business people, journalists and criminals. Almost 800 New Zealanders are featured on the list, including Jacinda Ardern's mother, father, and sister. Security Intelligence Service director Rebecca Kitteridge said they were reviewing the information for any potential risks and security concerns. However, at this stage Kitteridge said the information was primarily drawn from publicly accessible sources, such as social media and news reporting. "We know that different organisations compile information of this nature from publicly accessible sources for a range of purposes, ranging from private companies wanting to carry out marketing or research at one end of the spectrum, through to governments seeking to influence public discussion or gather intelligence in other countries at the other," Kitteridge said. "I understand people may be unaware their information could be gathered up in this way. "This is a timely reminder to everyone to check the security settings on their social media accounts and review the amount of information they are sharing on the internet." The American academic the information was initially leaked to says Zhenhua Data, the company behind the huge collection of personal details is linked to China's military and intelligence apparatus. Christopher Balding, a researcher at the University of California, Irvine, said 80 percent of the data is already public information. There had previously been debate over whether China had been collecting such information, but the leak proved it, he said. "It's very layered, there's also some technically complex instruments in that that reads information and translates it into Chinese and summarises it in a very short way. "So it's clearly meant for governments looking to gather large amounts of data rapidly." New Zealand First leader and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters earlier said no government officials have spoken with China about leaked data that includes prominent New Zealanders. From Tauranga today, Peters said he had received a briefing about what the data means and its possible impact but he did not want to overreact or alarm people. "I'm not going to stop the world and ring up our Beijing office and say 'do something about this'. Our job is to be careful and aware that this is happening and what our reaction should be. "I think our reaction is already under way anyway in that respect," he said. He described the likely purpose of the data as "evil". "I don't care what information they have on me but I do care when families can be manipulated, or members of families can be and where the objective may be ... a simple, evil purpose. "The assembly of that sort of information is not done for some beneficent purpose, it's done to gain some usually untoward advantage in circumstances where you should not be able to gain it. "I don't want to alarm people other than to say that privacy is a seriously important matter and ... government takes it very seriously." He said the government would not accept that kind of interference in New Zealand and its politics. "We are cognisant of it and we will not accept an interference in our country of that kind if that is what its intention is from whatever that inference might come from." National leader Judith Collins told RNZ's Morning Report that she should have been briefed by the Prime Minister on the leak. Peters would not say whether Collins was owed that briefing or not. "The briefing that she's seeking is owed from the Prime Minister, not me. "I can tell you that I've sent information to Simon Bridges who's the spokesman on Foreign Affairs for them over the last two months a number of times to make sure that he's brought up to date on responsibilities that I need to share with him. "It's at a different level, it's the Prime Minister's level." Labour minister Grant Robertson said the opposition was briefed regularly by New Zealand security agencies. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern earlier said the data leak, which includes the names of her mother, father and sister, highlighted the need for vigilance on cybersecurity. She was reluctant to comment on security matters however.

The party's health spokesperson Shane Reti says every single health target has worsened under the Labour-led government. "Even before Covid-19's emergence we were seeing cracks in our health system. Access to quality healthcare has slid backwards under Labour," he says. "Our health policy will deliver better care sooner, and closer to home. "Labour have spent more, yet many outcomes are worse. For example every single one of National's health targets are worse today than when we handed them over in 2017. "We have practical solutions that will offer tangible outcomes for generations to come." He says the party's plan would deliver a high quality, evidence-based modern health service regardless of location or identity, costed at $800m of new funding over four years. National would not reduce DHBs to between 8 and 12, or set up a Mori health authority, as Labour plans to do after receiving the Heather Simpson report, he says. Cancer Surgery Pharmac Primary Care General The party also announced a $30m childhood dental health policy yesterday, and has also promised to upgrade the Hawke's Bay Hospital and install air conditioning. Dr Reti says these are just some of the health initiatives the party would deliver if elected. "These are practical solutions that will have a tangible impact on New Zealander's lives for generations to come," he says. "National believes the Pharmac model is the best way to ensure New Zealanders are accessing much-needed medication." "Year on year this will be more funding for Pharmac than at any time in the past decade, and New Zealanders will have better access to more medicines. Dr Shane Reti. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone He says the primary care navigators have been trialled in the United Kingdom with positive outcomes. They would offer counselling, help unlock government agencies, follow up appointments and referrals and do home visits. "General Practitioners are often under significant time pressure which can lead to longer waiting times, and leaves them little time to address anything but their patient's immediate health concerns," he says. He says his experience working with the National Health Service in the UK has shown him that often the social worker type role they would fulfill is as important and often more important than the GP. "When I've been in practice myself and I look out at the waiting room and my list is full, my waiting room's full and yet I have a mental health consultation coming towards me... I don't want to be the one who misses a suicide patient, I need to be the one who does a really good job with this person but look at my waiting list, look at my waiting room. "Imagine if it could be that I did that initial triage, identified what the actions were... I need to understand better your work environment, I need to better understand your home environment, I need to understand better why government agencies have locked you out. "It'll make a big difference, it'll help deal with that tsunami of need that's coming towards primary care." On elective surgeries, he says 7312 surgeries promised for within four months were not delivered on time last year. He says the party introduced a tool to measure this called the elective surgery performance flow indicators, or ESPFLI. "But if I just pick a couple of DHBs - for Tairwhiti, it was 23. Tairwhiti must be able to do another 23 cases in a year. Let's go to a bigger DHB - for Capital and Coast is was 63 - surely Capital and Coast can do another 63 cases a year." Resolving the waiting lists would take priority over an extra funding for elective surgeries, but the party would also look at where that is needed, he says. "We think DHBs can do that and raising to the point that was raised here initially we're prepared to fund that as well." Despite rejecting recommendations to reduce the number of DHBs and establish a Mori health authority, Dr Reti says the party would consider some aspects of the Heather Simpson report, and it was not a waste of time. "It's an excellent data repository, some really good resources and information in that report ... and as I've indicated to you there are other suggestions in the Heather Simpson report that we would look at incorporating like the changing to adjustors in PBFF. He says there will be a separate announcement on mental health and disability next week. The party is also interested in exploring the possibility of a drug reuse programme, where unopened and unexpired drugs that have not been used can be returned, he says. Health Minister Chris Hipkins says National's track record shows it is more focused on spin in healthcare rather than actually improving outcomes. "We have to be cautious when it comes to National and targets because we know that they ultimately get manipulated. "In their last lot of targets they said that people had to be seen for a specialist first assessment within six months of joining the waiting lists for that so they simply managed that rationing the number of people that that could join the waiting list. "Some eye injections which would normally be done as a day procedure were transferred into a surgical setting where it costs more to deliver them because it made the elective surgery numbers look better. "That's the type of manipulation that really does the health system no good whatsoever, it's just an exercise in spin basically." On Dr Reti's claim that health targets have worsened under the Labour-led government, Hipkins says that's a reflection of the realities of underinvestment by the previous National government. "I think National's track record speaks for itself, which is they generally don't fund cost pressures faced by DHBs and that's one of the reasons DHBs are in deficits at the moment is there's just so much catching up to do. "What we're seeing is a more honest reflection of what's happening within the health system, we're not focused on manipulating targets, we're focused on trying to improve the quality of healthcare that New Zealanders get." He says Labour has already embarked on a very large reform programme in health, which would be the party's priority for the next term of government. "I think if you look at the record levels of investment that have gone in over the last three years we've had big increases in funding for our district health boards, we've had big increases in funding for capital investment - so upgrading our hospitals - and I think we can expect to see that level of commitment continue under a re-elected Labour government. "We set up the cancer control agency - something that seems to have slipped National's attention ... we've got a huge programme of work in mental health that's going to require an ongoing degree of focus. We want to get our health boards back in the black, it's not sustainable for them to be running the sort of deficits that they are at the moment." "I think anybody who follows health closely will just see more of the same from National."

Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon At at a public meeting in Tauranga this morning, Peters told media the party contacted him when the new political movement first formed. Peters would not say who approached him but said he did not give the idea any serious thought. "Yes, before they even got under way. They had this group formed, and I said no." "I said I'd keep it in confidence ... they wanted to join New Zealand First." The Advance NZ is led by disgraced former National MP Jami-Lee Ross and Billy Te Kahika, who has been criticised over misinformation and the spread of conspiracy theories. Peters said he did not know if there were more conspiracy theories now than in previous campaigns. "I don't know and it's not part of my campaign. We don't mind." "There are some flat earth societies in this world, there are some people whose understanding of the facts is actually appalling and there is a serious danger, particularly in the Mori and Polynesian world. "I'm more worried with the fact that they're breaking the rules where the Mori society's concerned and the Polynesian society's concerned, with the kind of flat earth society statements and looney tune statements based on nothing more than their sort of Jonestown suspicion. "They should get off the kool-aid and get out of this business if that's what they think that their purpose is."

In this series, the leaders are limited to the length of an elevator ride to pitch their party. In today's Elevator Pitch Green Party Co-leader James Shaw finds himself in a tiff with another leader and pushes his priorities for the party. In this episode Shaw tells Charlotte Cook why it should be a part of the next government. James Shaw reveals who he would fight for (in a non-violent way), and gushes about his crush on a comic strip from the 80s. He said the Green Party had achieved so much in three years, and deserved another term in government to continue proving itself. Although when it comes to a policy it wouldn't negotiate on, Shaw said: "We don't have bottom lines, we have top priorities." But he ran out of floors to get them all out. In previous episodes, National Party leader Judith Collins says she would like to pinch a Green MP and Winston Peters refuses to let his cartoon crush slip. The Elevator Pitch is a five-part series where leaders of the main parties pitch why someone should vote for them in the time it takes to ride the elevator.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426172/pacific-climate-activists-switch-focus-to-increasing-voter-engagement|2020-09-16|A Pacific youth-led activist group which has led climate strikes in New Zealand is now encouraging its communities to get to the polls for this year's general election. Photo: RNZ Pacific / Sela Jane Hopgood Pacific Climate Warriors, based in Auckland and Wellington, has been running an online campaign called Pacific Votes Count since July 2020. "We will be working to empower Pacific communities to recognise the importance and influence of their vote by supporting our people to enrol to vote, engage in robust discussion and help them make informed decisions on who they believe best represents their views and what is important to them," Wellington co-ordinator Mary Moeono-Kolio said. The 2017 election turnout was low in areas with large Pacific communities - a good example being South Auckland. Mandy Bohte from the Electoral Commission said the only ethnicity data they collect is for Mori, but there is available data on electorates, which can give people an indication as to how Pacific turnout went in the last election. "When we look at census data and when we look at population in particular electorates where there are a larger population of Pacific communities that the enrolment rates are quite high, around 90 percent really," she said. "However, the turnout rate tends to be much lower, so people are going through the process of getting themselves enrolled, but they're not turning out to vote and have their say on the day or during that election period." Pacific Climate Warriors - Mary Moeono-Kolio to the right Photo: Supplied / 350 Pacific Moeono-Kolio explained that competing priorities are a major barrier as to why the majority of Pacific people struggle to vote. "For us, we're thinking of whether we'll have food on the table, are our kids going to have shoes on their feet when they go to school or full stomachs to keep them going throughout the day. "Some of us are worrying about whether we can afford to get to school," she said. "These are real issues that I think often people think are competing with whether I should vote or not, and what we're saying to people is actually it's very simple, and in order for us to address those daily issues that are barriers to us participating in political spaces, you need to vote." A young Pacific voter accompanying her elderly mother to pay the bills in Mngere recently shared that she was not sure who she was going to vote for in the upcoming election. "I think I'm going to vote - actually, I'm unsure. The only person I know is Sua William Sio," she said. Brianna Fruean from Pacific Climate Warriors' Auckland branch said the warriors have switched their focus from the climate to voting, in the face of the major challenges facing the community. Brianna Fruean Photo: Supplied "We are passionate about climate change, but for some people it's hard to get out to the climate strike if maybe the night before they didn't have a warm house to live in," she shared. "We have heard stories from our own people say it's too hard to do a project on climate change because they're worrying about their parents' wages, so this is what inspired us to start the Pacific Votes Count campaign. "We know in our communities there are issues that are more of a priority for us that we need to address before we even start talking about something like climate change." Pacific Climate Warriors have gone online with topics such as parties' policies, MP profiles, as well as Zoom discussions for first time voters with guests, including senior health expert Dr Colin Tukuitonga. Last month they also conducted an online survey to gauge what is most important to Pacific people. There was over 500 people who responded to the survey. Moeono-Kolio revealed that warm and affordable housing, quality healthcare and fair wages were the top priorities. "We want to use the results from the survey to inform our own outreach, but also go back to the people who are standing in for election and say Pacific communities in Aotearoa say that these are the most important things to them." Photo: RNZ Pacific / Sela Jane Hopgood The Electoral Commission has been working with Pasifika communities since 2017 to make voting more accessible. Bohte said feedback included not feeling confident in the voting process on the day and about whether their vote will make a difference. "We're recruiting people from the community who understand their community, talking to church groups, youth leaders, around demystifying the electoral process to ensure people do know that it is easy. "We want people working on voting day to reflect the community because it can be quite scary going into the voting booth," she said. "We want to ensure that when you walk in to vote, you see people you know from your community and that will hopefully assist with breaking down some of those feelings of not being confident in your ability to cast your vote,"

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426263/economist-concerned-government-s-plan-for-growth-worsens-inequality|2020-09-17|An economist says the New Zealand economy could recover from a recession like the global financial crisis but would likely be tracking lower for longer. Economist Shamubeel Eaqub. Photo: RNZ The government opened its books for Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update, also known as the PREFU, yesterday and the picture is bad but not as bad as expected. While political parties clashed over the interpretation, Sense Partners economist Shamubeel Eaqub told Morning Report around the world the expectations had gone from the economic situation becoming catastrophic to the "outlook is not as bad". He said instead of the big short sharp drop, economists were now predicting a longer period of slower economic growth. "Our level of debt, even when all the spending is done, is going to be around 55 percent of GDP. In the context of the OECD even before the pandemic it wasn't extraordinary." Eaqub said now was the time to discuss ways to pay back the debt. "We are facing still a very big economic shock. There will be hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who will lose jobs, many businesses will fail, there is still a lot of work to be done." He said if the government kept continuing on the same track, eventually there would not be enough taxes to pay for all the things it pays for now. The renewed forecast from Treasury showed that there was a possibility of the same situation as after the global financial crisis. "You recover from the recession but you're permanently on lower track." He said New Zealand's economic growth over the past 40 years had consistently averaged about 2.8 percent a year. He questioned what new steps the government would take to boost economic growth other than housing and immigration. "More of the same is not going to give us better outcomes. "We have tried to have this growth in property prices, growth in borrowing, growth in immigration without having the increase in the productive capacity of the economy, infrastructure - it is really not going to work. "There's kind of this disconnect between saying that we're going to just crank up what we've done before and we're going to get better economic outcomes in the future. I just don't buy it." He said although the economy had been growing over the past 40 years, there was not much improvement to inequality. "I haven't really heard much on this campaign trail around what's going to be remarkably different. In some ways, I think, the pain still hasn't been enough for us to be forced into having a conversation. "I look back through New Zealand's history, you know, we kind of had that kind of big reorganisation of politics and economics post the Great Depression and wars, we had that again through that period of post-Muldoon and now I think we are coming into the next reckoning." Eaqub said there needed to be a discussion about modern monetary theory. "That's not where we're heading at this time," Finance Minister Grant Robertson said. "It is important for me that we provide some stability here." "We do have an independent monetary strategy governed by the Reserve Bank in New Zealand, and while there has been some shortcomings to that over the years it has served us relatively well. I think right now a major structural change to our system such as that isn't desirable. Having said that, things we used to call alter monetary policy - for example quantitative easing - are now very much in the mainstream." He told Morning Report now was not the time to make a structural change to the system. "We do have to do more to improve the amount of housing that's available ... and we will continue to work across the economy to lift the value of what we do," - Finance Minister Grant Robertson Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas "We'll keep our eye on that but I am prioritising stability and continuity at a time of massive uncertainty for New Zealanders. He said there was no silver bullet solution. "Going for any single silver bullet I think is a mistake, it has to be a balanced plan. We've got to be careful about the money that we're spending, we've got to invest in critical public services, we've got to make sure that we are using the tax system and we are doing that by asking the top 2 percent of earners to do a bit more." He admitted investing in more than just immigration and housing would be key, and said that formed part of the government's "five-point economic plan". "That does mean significant investment in our education system, it does mean significant investment in infrastructure and construction, but it also means taking the industries that we're good at now and adding value to them. "We have an industry transformation plan for agritech that we've already kicked off with the agricultural sector to lift its productivity to build higher-wage jobs. We actually have to do that right across the economy in areas - from digital skills to construction to infrastructure." The Treasury report showed New Zealand emerging from the lockdowns better than expected but facing years of large deficits and ballooning debt. Robertson has concerns about the Treasury's predictions regarding housing and immigration. It said immigration was expected to increase to 35,000 by 2022 and the housing market growth would continue - continuing to lock many out of the housing market and increasing inequality. "As I have been clear over some months now, we are going to have higher levels of debt and a deficit for some time to come. That is the nature of responding to a one-in-a-hundred-year shock." Robertson said keeping debt under control was not the only indicator of the health of the economy. "Since we came into government we have attempted to shift the focus so that it is not exclusively on the traditional indicators but we have included within the wellbeing budget other indicators. "Our approach to Covid-19 has been grounded in that wellbeing approach, we prioritised New Zealanders' health and wellbeing in the short term to deliver us a long term health and economic benefit." The Treasury's report also showed rising unemployment and house prices are likely to extend already deep inequalities. Far North Mori social housing provider He Korowai Trust chief executive Ricky Houghton said the demand for housing was "progressively getting worse". He Korowai Trust chief executive Ricky Houghton. Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook The trust has received $1.8 million investment for infrastructure to build 24 houses. He told Morning Report the large number of people returning home, and the lack of infrastructure and capacity was making it difficult to cope. "All the services are on overload." He said there was a need for more funding and compliance needed to be eased so people on lower incomes could build homes, instead of converting campervans and buses. "At the end of the day what's killing the ability for the people up here to move ahead with their housing is compliance cost. They just cannot afford to comply with anything." Houghton said, for now, they were transporting relocatable homes from Auckland which would otherwise be demolished. There were almost 75,000 hectares of undeveloped Mori land up in the north, he said. Prior to Covid-19, up to 85 percent of the community was on some form of the benefit, he said - 87 percent were single parents, and the average income in the Far North is $21,000. The influx of people means more were living in overcrowded houses. "In terms of the pandemic, if it were to hit the Far North in a big way - there's no water, there's no ability for people to wash their hands, toilet facilities, sanitation is non-existent. There's a lot of overcrowding, so it would spread like wildfire if it took a hold on the Far North."

Finance minister Grant Robertson. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas The pre-election opening of the government books (PREFU) showed a budget deficit of $23.4 billion for the year ended June, while the level of debt is marginally better at 27.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). "These are signs that the New Zealand economy is robust, and that our plan to eliminate Covid-19 and open the economy faster is the right approach," Finance Minister Grant Robertson said. Treasury Secretary Caralee McLeish said the impact of lockdowns was less severe than initially thought. "The New Zealand economy benefited from earlier than expected lifting of alert level restrictions in the June quarter. Within alert levels, activity appears to be higher than estimated and higher frequency economic indicators suggests that our activity has picked up sooner than expected." The shorter lockdowns and strong rebound in activity have helped to support government finances with the tax take moderately lower on a year ago, while the initial measures to support households and businesses caused government spending to surge to $108.8 billion. Robertson said government spending had cushioned the blow of a one-in-100 year shock, which would need to be maintained for the near and medium term. He warned that the better-than-expected economic and fiscal situation would get tougher and take longer than had been forecast in the May budget. "There will be tough times ahead for many in our country," Robertson told a PREFU media briefing. His constant refrain was the dire situation globally and uncertainty in the world economy. "Predictions and projections based on history have little of substance to tell us about an unprecedented future," he said. "Overall the near term economic outlook is less negative than that contained in the Budget update while the medium-term outlook is weaker ... the former is a result of an improved domestic performance in New Zealand, the latter the result of a less favorable global environment affecting export prices and global output in New Zealand. The Treasury has forecast the economy will average annual growth of 2.8 percent over the next four years from a budget forecast of 3.9 percent. Robertson said the Treasury was anticipating a 16 percent decrease in GDP in the June 2020 quarter. "[It's] a historically large decline, but much smaller than the almost 24 percent forecast in the Budget update ... this is a global pandemic and it remains ongoing around the world. Many other advanced economies continue to struggle with heavily restricted economies and are having to manage large flare-ups of the virus. Our relative ongoing success in managing the virus still puts us at an advantage. GDP figures are expected out tomorrow and are almost guaranteed to show a second quarter of declining growth - which would mean recession. "Officially that doesn't happen till tomorrow but, as I said, I was clear six months ago that we would be in recession and I'm sure we will be," Robertson said. "How far and how deep that is we'll see the first indications of tomorrow but what I would say is we rebound quickly from that on the forecasts ... as we get into 2021 and 2022, our growth is outpacing our trading partners. "I do note that in these numbers our unemployment is forecast to peak lower than where Australia is ... our debt for this year will be lower than Australia's is and I do note that our growth going out to 2021 and 2022 will be better than Australia's is." Treasury has also trimmed its unemployment forecast to peak at 7.7 percent next year after which it gradually declines over the next four years to 5.3 percent. "This compares favourably with other nations, Australia with around 10 percent, the US and Canada with 13 percent peaks. Budget 2020 forecast that unemployment was going to peak at 268,000, in prefu it peaks at 221,000. That is 50,000 fewer people unemployed," Robertson said. That is based on an assumption that borders will remain closed until 2022, and that world growth will be lower and slower because of resurgence of the virus around the world. Consequently government spending and borrowing will remain elevated for sometime. Announcing the update, Finance Minister Grant Robertson had said the 2022 date was an assumption by the Treasury, not government policy, and the government planned to open borders as soon as it was safely able to do so. Net debt is now forecast to peak at 55.3 percent of GDP in 2024, marginally higher than in the budget, while budget deficits peak next year at $31.7bn, before reducing to $12.4bn in 2024. "The government met our target to lower net debt to 20 percent of GDP in both our first two budgets, putting us in a strong position to respond to Covid-19 and still maintain one of the lowest levels of debt in the OECD. "The borrowing is necessary... but it comes at a cost," Robertson said. He said the government planned to spend $42bn on infrastructure over the next four years including $12.25bn in this fiscal year alone, compared to $43.7bn over the eight years between 2009 and 2017. "The answer to our current economic predicament is not to pull back on investment in infrastructure and critical public services that enable us to bounce back as happened during the last downturn. We must continue to invest in our economic recovery and rebuild. He said the government had $14.1bn uncommitted to be spent on future measures if there should be a significant return of Covid-19 to the country. "We can afford the debt without cutting key core services... we will manage the books responsibly... we will keep a balance." He said the government saw a "massively important role" for the Mori economy, with post-settlement iwi in particular helping drive sustainable growth. He acknowledged Mori would be worse affected by the economic downturn than the wider population. "In times of recession we see Mori population affected more, that's why we've put significant investments in through our Covid response and recovery fund to supporting Mori households, to boosting Whnau Ora ... but it's also why we need to work incredibly hard to stay down low in the alert levels because that enables the economy across the board to continue to grow."

Dave Ashby runs a dairy farm in North Canterbury. Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver The Greens unveiled its agriculture policy in Canterbury at the weekend, where the party announced its plans to levy nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser sales. They also want to establish an almost $300 million fund for the transition to regenerative and organic farming. Environmental consultant Dave Ashby runs a dairy farm in North Canterbury. Keeping animals fenced out, planting along the banks and adding oxygen weed are just a few of the measures he takes to keep his waterways clean. To prove how clean the water is at his man-made drain he took a handful and drank it. "So this takes all the water off my dairy farm and I just drank it right in front of you," he said. He said farmers were working hard to farm more sustainably, especially through farm environment plans (FEP). "Plans are more now diverse, they include not only the irrigation and nutrient and soils and the management of animal effluent, they also include things such as water use, biodiversity and also provision for mahinga kai and other cultural needs." Ashby said in Canterbury those plans (FEPs) are then audited. Green Party co-leader James Shaw. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone But on Saturday the Greens announced its plan to make farms more environmentally friendly. Co-leader James Shaw said the party planned to introduce a $297m fund over three years to support farmers into regenerative or organic farming. "The dairy sector themselves know and are working with other sectors and with government in order to provide this transition towards more sustainable forms of farming that have lower greenhouse gas emissions and less nitrogen going into our soils and into our water. "Much of this came from them saying look we want to actually be the solution here but people need the support and so that's what we are trying to do," he said. But with the carrot comes the stick. The party plans to pay for that fund in part using $33.9m raised through a nitrogen and phosphorous fertiliser levy. The levy will be 2c per every kilo, which the party claimed would cost the average dairy farm $1515 annually. But Ashby said that would not make farming more sustainable. "A better thing to do rather than a tax is to benefit farmers to help them complete farm environment plans and maintain those plans. "A farm environment plan, in my opinion, is the vehicle to change, a further tax to farmers will create further pressure on farmers and will create another layer of cost to the farming industry," he said. The Greens' policy also included a limit on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in waterways of 1mg per litre. It would also want to progressively reduce nitrogen fertiliser application to the 150kg per hectare national average within two years. National Party agriculture spokesperson David Bennett said the Greens' proposed nitrogen limits and levy would be devastating for farmers, in particular, the dairy farming industry. "At a time when we need agricultural exports more than any other time because of what has happened with Covid and the borders the Green Party wants to send agriculture back 100 years. "That will really limit our ability to sustain the economy in very dark times," he said. Bennett said the policy was a slap in the face for farmers.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425854/election-2020-how-much-can-you-trust-the-polls|2020-09-11|By Josh Van Veen* Comment - Is the 2020 election result really the foregone conclusion that the polls and commentators are suggesting? Josh Van Veen suggests otherwise, pointing to some of the shortcomings of opinion polling, which could have some politicians saying "bugger the pollsters" on election night. The complexities of human psychology mean political parties can take nothing for granted, Josh Van Veen writes. Photo: RNZ In November 1993, opinion polls foretold a comfortable victory for the incumbent National Party. But there was no clear outcome on election night. For a brief moment, it appeared that the Labour Party of Mike Moore could reclaim power with support from the new left-wing Alliance. The upset led then-prime minister Jim Bolger to exclaim, "Bugger the pollsters!" To his relief the final count gave National a one-seat majority. Jim Bolger, Photo: RNZ/Rebekah Parsons-King Twenty-seven years later, polling suggests that Jacinda Ardern is on the cusp of forming her own single party majority government. Bolger was the last prime minister to enjoy such a mandate. The 1993 general election ushered in a new era of multiparty politics. A succession of coalition and minority governments would follow - right up to the present. But this era could soon be over. At the time of writing, Labour is projected to win more than the 61 seats needed to govern alone. Statistician Peter Ellis calculates a 0.1 percent chance that National can form the next government. These numbers may sound fanciful, whatever your politics, but they are based on highly credible data from the country's two most successful polling companies. In the past nine months, 1News/Colmar Brunton and Newshub/Reid Research have released a total of seven polls between them. They have told more or less the same story. In the aftermath of the first lockdown, support for Labour reached historic levels, while National collapsed to under 30 percent. Act has surged, the Greens are perilously close to the threshold, and NZ First languishes around 3 percent. With Labour ahead by such a wide margin, it appears that the election is more or less a foregone conclusion. But is it really? In 2017, the final Reid Research poll had an average discrepancy of just 0.7 percentage points when it came to estimating support for the main parties, compared to the final result. Colmar Brunton and Roy Morgan were out by an average 1.4 and 2.7 points respectively. While these differences are usually within the reported margins of sampling error, a percentage point or two can be crucial. If, for example, National had maintained its election night support of 46 percent in the final count it is quite possible that Bill English would still be the prime minister. That is why polls are more useful for reading trends than making predictions. In 2020, commentators and journalists have dismissed the possibility of a National victory. The received wisdom is that most voters have now made up their minds and the next month is unlikely to see much change in public opinion. But this overlooks the number of undecided and wavering voters. In the 2017 NZ Election Study, for example, around 20 percent reported making up their minds during the final week (including election day itself). In the last Colmar Brunton poll, 10 percent of the respondents said they were undecided and 4 percent refused to answer. The headline results (e.g. Labour 53 percent) are calculated by excluding those respondents who either "don't know" or refuse to say. If we did include the undecideds in the base of the calculation for party support then Labour would be on 47 percent. Those undecided voters could at least determine whether or not Labour governs alone. Furthermore, it is impossible to know how committed individual respondents are to voting a particular way - or even voting at all. Although respondents are asked "how likely" they are to vote, neither Colmar Brunton nor Reid Research take into account the effect of non-voting. In other words, no assumption is made about the probability someone will vote based on their demographic profile. This means that while their samples are representative of the general population, it is difficult to know how representative they are of the voting public. Some are a lot more likely to vote than others. For example, over-70s had a turnout rate of 86 percent in the last election compared to only 69 percent for 18-24-year-olds. It is possible that unrepresentative sampling of certain age groups might explain historic discrepancies between polling and real support for NZ First and the Greens. Last time, Colmar Brunton underestimated support for NZ First by a significant 2.3 points, while Roy Morgan overestimated Green support by 2.7 points. The reported margin of sampling error typically means that we can be 95 percent confident a poll is no more than "plus or minus" a few percentage points from true public opinion. However, that figure refers to a result of 50 percent. In the Colmar Brunton example above, the margin of error for NZ First was approximately 1.4 percentage points. In other words, the poll was dodgy. This is said to happen five times out of 100. But the margin of sampling error does not measure other possible sources of error such as interviewer effects and question wording. There is also the problem of how reliable those surveyed are. In 1992, after polls failed to predict a Conservative victory in Britain, an inquiry found that some respondents had probably lied about their voting intention ("the shy Tory factor"). Such effects are impossible to quantify. However, more recent experience from Britain (2015) and the United States (2016) suggests that systematic polling error is most likely to result from assumptions regarding turnout. To a large extent, polling for the 2016 Presidential election failed to register Trump support in the so-called "Rust Belt" states because pollsters did not sample enough non-college educated white voters. After the 2015 British general election, an independent review determined that pollsters had significantly undersampled over-70s. This was at least in part down to the use of online panels such as that employed by Reid Research to supplement its telephone sample. Interestingly, some evidence was also found that those people most likely to answer the phone were much less inclined to vote Conservative. Pollsters in 2016 failed to pick up Donald Trump's support in the so-called "Rust Belt" states - a factor in his surprise victory. Photo: AFP The fact that Colmar Brunton and Reid Research make no assumptions about turnout could be a strength. But in the end, polling is not an exact science. No survey design can fully capture all the complexities of human psychology and voting behaviour. There will always be a degree of uncertainty. The extent to which any given poll is right or wrong may in fact come down to how it is reported and framed by the media. To better inform the public, TVNZ and Newshub should report the estimated range of party support rather than a single figure. They could also disclose the response rate (likely to be under 30 percent), and provide a full disclaimer about the limitations of polling. But that would mean less sensationalism. So, can we trust the polls? The answer will just have to wait until election night.

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425661/labour-s-tax-rise-a-half-measure-with-not-much-payoff|2020-09-09|By Liam Hehir* Opinion - The government will only receive roughly $2 more per New Zealander per week to spend on social services or reduce the national debt with the tax rises announced today. Only 2 percent of New Zealanders will be affected by Labour's plan to lift the tax rate for the highest earners, Liam Hehir writes. Photo: 123RF During the early 2000s, when the global economy was strong, the New Zealand government ran a budget surplus year after year. The Clark government had also introduced a top income tax rate of 39 percent in 1999. This was payable by all income earners pulling in more than $60,000 a year. Unsurprisingly, pressure for tax cuts began to build. Then minister of finance Michael Cullen stood firm against public demand. This came at an increasing political cost and in 2005 the government agreed to concede the indexation of tax thresholds to inflation. This reform was fairly significant but did little to quell voter dissatisfaction due to its delayed payoff. The additional income that a typical earner was able to keep was likened to a packet of chewing gum a week. That description was probably too generous given that in many cases the benefit was just 67 cents a week. Even back then a pack of PK was more than a dollar. This failure to read the room very nearly cost Labour the election. The National Party, then led by Don Brash, had made strong gains with the Orewa moment the year before but had begun to flag in the polls. Cullen's half-hearted measure put National back in contention. It took the promise of interest-free student loans to take momentum back. In a strange way, Grant Robertson's announcement of Labour's tax policy today shares some characteristics with the chewing gum budget. Acquiescing to the demands of activists, the party proposes to introduce a new tax rate of 39 percent on all income exceeding $180,000 annually. That's more cautious than many had predicted. The plan of Grant Robertson, right, is reminiscent of a Budget overseen by former finance minister Michael Cullen, Liam Hehir writes. Photo: RNZ However, it does ensure that the new rate will only fall on the genuinely well-off. Only 2 percent of New Zealanders earn that much, after all. On the other hand, that does mean that the revenue raised by the tax will be very modest - the estimate is $550 million per year. Even that may be optimistic. Labour proposes to leave the company tax rate at 28 percent and the trust tax rate at 33 percent, which will leave the door open to tax minimisation through good planning. There is a limit to how much people can use companies and trusts to reduce their tax burden. However, the less aligned the various rates are the greater the potential savings and the more value there is in the time and hassle involved in minimising your tax. But even if we take the estimated new revenues at face value, the government will only receive roughly two dollars more per New Zealander per week to spend on social services or reduce the national debt. At the same time, the increased tax will have all the usual downsides of sucking money out of the productive economy through decreased investment and increased tax planning. Lawyers and accountants will do very well out of it. Like his predecessor, Robertson has gone for a half-measure. If Labour wanted to increase revenue the threshold would have kicked in much lower. A 39 percent rate of tax on all incomes over $90,000 per annum would, for example, have matched the settings that Helen Clark implemented in 1999. Alternatively, an intermediate step could have been introduced (say, a rate of 36 percent on incomes over $140,000). Such rates may not have been wise, overall. But they would have made more sense from a revenue perspective. Instead, what Labour proposes to do is to maximise the downside of increased tax while minimising the upside. However, it is worth remembering that not all New Zealanders are on the same page when it comes to the purpose of taxation. For many Labour Party stalwarts and activists, the raising of revenue is just one, and not even the primary, purpose of taxing incomes. Reducing the disposable incomes of the wealthy is sometimes seen as a worthy end unto itself. Seen through this lens, the new rate will achieve its purpose the day it is enacted. Any reduction in investment will be a regrettable side-effect. Rather than being rooted in the desire for any tangible outcome, the purpose of the increased tax is found in the "moral victory" of thumping the rich. The chewing gum budget was so badly received that Labour ultimately scrapped the proposed cuts. It was better to offer nothing than something so paltry. The difference here is Robertson's plans will only impact a small number of New Zealanders directly. So their lack of effectiveness will probably not damage Labour. Which is lucky for them. It is unlikely that Robertson has enough fiscal headroom to pull something like interest free student loans out of the bag. He would need to raise taxes much more to do that. *Liam Hehir is from Rongotea, a small village in the Manawat hinterland.

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425646/labour-s-tax-plan-framing-around-covid-19-both-clever-and-cynical|2020-09-09|Power Play - Call it what you want - canny politics or a left-wing betrayal - Labour's tax plan is far from transformational. Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern with finance spokesperson Grant Roberston and small business spokesperson Stuart Nash. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Even National could barely muster much outrage, instead stoking fear about what else Labour might do if held ransom by the Greens. But the change promised here - a new tax bracket at 39 percent on income over $180,000 - is milder than what many Kiwis will remember under the Helen Clark-years. The plan promises to capture just the top 2 percent - 75,000-odd people - unlikely to find much sympathy among those fearing job losses and a looming recession. It won't even include most backbench MPs who merrily pocket about $160,000 a year. Left-wing voters may well be disappointed, but they should not be surprised. Jacinda Ardern has repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to tackle the question of tax, still smarting from her scare in the final stretch of the 2017 campaign. Ardern well remembers how her rising popularity suddenly halted as National seized on her uncertain position on a capital gains tax (CGT). Spooked, she kicked for touch, promising no major tax changes in her first term. A tax working group was tasked with finding a solution. Instead it caused more problems for Labour, so much so Ardern binned its chief proposal and promised to never introduce a CGT while prime minister. With its sky-high polling, Labour now has more license to drive political change, but Ardern is not willing to risk it. Labour is convinced it has done the unthinkable and become the party of choice for the business community. It is determined to cement its hold on the middle. It leaves those on the left who want more dramatic change looking to the Greens. The minor party - which is campaigning on a wealth tax and two more top income brackets - was quick to issue a promise to put a bit of steel into Labour's spine. That may offer hope to some on the left, but it's just as likely to foment fear among the centre-right. National is already fanning those flames, questioning what Labour might do in partnership with the Green Party. Pressed on the matter, finance spokesperson Grant Robertson would only repeat Labour's policy: no other increases or new taxes. The blunt reality is everything could be on the table when it comes to negotiating for the government benches and National will do all it can to capitalise on that uncertainty. National's previous success with such tactics also helps to explain Labour's caution. Notice that nowhere in Labour's media release do the words "fair and progressive tax system" feature, its stated objective when selling its policy in 2017. Instead, the government has framed its tax plan in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The reframing is both clever and cynical. Fairness is subjective. Covid-19 is concrete. Nearly everyone accepts that Covid-19 has changed the world and policies will need to change with it if countries are to survive. The struggling need support. Debt needs to be paid back. The irony is the proposed new tax bracket does very little toward either goal. Robertson claims it will raise $550 million a year, which may sound a lot but works out at roughly one week of the Covid-19 wage subsidy. Meanwhile, the country is staring down an extra $140 billion in debt. Labour's tax policy also ignores the critical question of capital - a crisis in the making as asset prices climb at extraordinary pace. Income tax changes are relatively simple to explain to the public, particularly when targeted at the fat cats in town. But taxes on assets - whether land or wealth - are trickier. They're often complicated and affect a far greater number of people. Never mind Ardern's self-imposed CGT impasse. The absence of a CGT may be "a clear weakness" according to former Labour finance minister Sir Michael Cullen, but it is one Ardern has trapped herself with. All the while, the housing crisis - which Labour railed against in 2017 - is getting worse by the day. House prices are soaring as the Reserve Bank does everything it can to drive down interest rates, and the gap between the rich and poor grows wider still. To date, neither Labour nor National have shown any desire to address or even acknowledge the problem. And nothing in Labour's tax policy today suggests that will change.

Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas It's altering the rules around its $42b spend on goods and services. Now, 138 departments and agencies must actively consider how they can create quality jobs with an emphasis on getting groups such as Mori and Pacific people, people with disabilities and women. There'll also be a greater focus on sustainable construction practices. Economic Development Minister Phil Twyford told Morning Report "there's real potential to do good". He says the agencies and departments need to do the work right at the beginning of the procurement process so it's not simply ticking a box at the end. "It's not a micromanagement approach where central government, one team of people at MBIE, are determining the very detail of every tendering process..." Success will be measured through the gathering of data, he said. "We know Mori businesses and workers, particularly Mori women in the hospitality and tourism sectors, have been hit hard by the impacts of Covid-19," Mori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta said. "Government procurement of goods and services offers the economic stimulus to boost Mori SMEs and help create a resilient Mori economy." Pacific Peoples Minister Aupito William Sio says the Pacific Business Procurement Support initiative is helping Pacific companies build their capability so they can survive the immediate impacts of Covid-19 and over time grow their companies. The government is partnering with the Pacific Business Trust to boost Pacific procurement, he said.

RNZ reporter Katie Doyle and visual journalist Dan Cook headed to Botany to find out what voters think of Ross' latest move. The disgraced former National Party MP announced this morning that he will not be standing in Botany - the seat he has held since 2011. Ross' Advance New Zealand Party has teamed up with Billy TK's controversial New Zealand Public Party - and their electoral fortunes now depend on them getting either 5 percent of the vote, or the Far North Mori seat. At the 2017 election, as a National Party MP, Ross won the Botany seat with more than 60 percent of the vote. But since then, he has had a spectacular falling out with National - leaving the party, but remaining in Parliament as an independent MP to represent his Auckland electorate.https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/420740/jami-lee-ross-appears-in-court-ahead-of-electoral-fraud-trialHe is also awaiting trial on electoral fraud charges laid by the Serious Fraud Office. He had been gearing up to contest the seat again, up against National's Christopher Luxon and Labour's Naisi Chen, but this morning he changed tack and pulled out of the race. Voters in Botany aren't too upset by the news. "Fantastic and good riddance to him... He's let us down a lot over the years so, time to go I think," one man says - adding that Ross didn't have a chance of winning. Another voter said: "Him - not very impressed with him, his morals and things he's done". Yet another said he didn't think the people of Botany would feel let down by Ross pulling out. Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook Advance NZ's partnership with the New Zealand Public Party is what Ross says prompted him to drop out of the botany race. Ross, who says he will now be second on Advance NZ's list, wants to focus on the party's nationwide campaign so Te Kahika, who will be number one on the list, can focus on winning Te Tai Tokerau. "So we had to make a call, which one of us is the person who runs hard in an electorate seat, which one of us is the one who runs the campaign nationwide and brings the team together, so I'm effectively taking on that role. Billy is energetic and working hard in [Te] Tai Tokerau, he's a fighter that will bring the fight to the Labour Party there," Ross says. Botany is a safe National seat - in 2017, National got 60 percent of the party vote. Ross is adamant he didn't drop out of the Botany race, because he didn't like his chances of winning. "This was turning out to be a three-way race, the Labour candidate Naisi Chen is strong and working hard, the National Party has obviously got support here as well, but equally, I've got name recognition and a 10-year track record as the local MP. I couldn't spend the time that was required to campaign effectively. I wanted to run a nationwide campaign with Advance New Zealand so I had to make a hard call, I had to make that decision" Political commentator and former National Party staffer Ben Thomas disagrees, and says Botany is far from being marginal - it's true blue. He says if anything, Ross is saving face ahead of a big loss. "Jami-Lee Ross himself said that Botany was turning into a three-way race. That wouldn't be the first fantastical claim he's made over the last year and a half since leaving the National Party." In a statement, National Party candidate Christopher Luxon - whose face is peppered on billboards throughout Botany - said he was focused on the people of his electorate. He wanted to continue being a strong advocate for Botany and the National Party, he said.

New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers Cabinet decided yesterday to keep the country in the same alert levels for another week, prompting New Zealand First to invoke the agree to disagree provision. In Gisborne today, Peters said he did not get any data at Cabinet about the impact of the lockdown on Auckland's economy. "If you do an evaluation of what the past looked like and what's not happening now, it's not difficult to do that equation ... I've seen traffic movements and I've seen credit card spend, that's not a granular way to examine how an economy looks. "That data is not and has not been prepared for the decision we made yesterday. We asked in New Zealand First 'can you tell us what the economic cost of a lockdown in Auckland would be?' ... we never got it then and we still haven't got it." "You should have seen it yesterday when the decision was announced and defended, surely. And you should have seen it when the lockdown happened the first time, which we say in New Zealand First is unnecessary, and we still stand by that, there's been no cases at all since April around the rest of the South Island." He says that sort of information should be provided to the public and to all parties and during an election campaign. "After all we did campaign on transparency and fiscal transparency, and the legislation that's now 30 years old demands that this be out in front of the public so the public knows what the truth is." He says the economy is in serious decline and the public has no idea just how much. "The effect here is between 15 and 20 percent, far worse than Australia ... they were saying it was gonna be under 15 percent. I'm saying it's gonna be higher. "Australians have done far better than us and they're falling a far shorter distance than us in terms of economic turnaround and you've got to ask yourself why would that be." He says government statements on the economy are not being backed up by facts. "Go and ask some serious economists like Cameron Bagrie and others what do they think and they'll tell you otherwise, so why are they not being listened to in this case." New Zealand's gross domestic product (GDP) figures are due out on Thursday, and expected to show the economy in recession. He says GDP is the standard measure of economy but that it does not show the quality of economic activity. "Quality of economic activity is more important. Is it exports, is it manufacturing takeup in our country? Is it added value in our country? Does the wealth stay in our country? None of those things are answered by the GDP equation." National Party leader Judith Collins says she is not expecting to see the economy in a good position. "I'm expecting to see that the books are not in a very good position with the government and I think that we'll wait to see exactly what the extent of that is. "The fact that Grant Robertson is trying to talk down the economy at the moment tells us that he knows there is something unpleasant on its way for New Zealanders and it's all about the economy. "We're pricing in the downturn in the economy ... you'll see that our numbers add up." RNZ is seeking comment from Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426066/labour-pledges-to-focus-on-apprenticeships-scrap-decile-system|2020-09-15|Labour has announced it won't be extending the fees-free tertiary programme past the first year of study, instead prioritising free apprenticeships and targeted areas of vocational training. Watch the announcement here: Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins has announced the initiative as part of the party's $1.7 billion education package announced in Porirua today. The party says it will provide free access to all apprenticeships and to many trades training courses for the next two years if elected. "We will be targeting our additional tertiary education spending in areas that are critical for the country's economic recovery in the post-Covid environment," Hipkins says. "We're putting trades and vocational training back on the map, and that includes free apprenticeships and free vocational training in those areas where New Zealand has skill shortage. He attributes the decision not to extend fees-free tertiary education beyond the first year to the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the funding had been redirected into skill shortage areas. He denies the virus is being used to cover up the failure of the fees-free policy. "That's what's gonna give us a better bang for our buck ... it is an admission that it's the sort of thing that you do when the economic going is good rather than at a time that you need to invest in order to keep the country moving." He says the initiatives will be supported by the reform of the Vocational Education System which will be completed if the party is re-elected. Labour says tens of thousands of learners are eligible to save between $2500 and $6000 a year under this policy. From 2022, the party would also implement the Equality Index in schools, scrapping the current decile system. In September 2019, Hipkins first pledged to scrap the decile system saying it made sense to use a system that more accurately predicted whether children were at risk of failure. He says the equity system is expected to mean an extra $75 million in funding for schools and early learning - an increase of about 50 percent, up from $150m. "We want every child no matter who they are or where they come from to have the opportunity to fulfil their potential and live life to the fullest. This is a huge step towards addressing the inequities in our public education system. "Once it's fully implemented the new funding system is expected to involve additional funding of $75m per year, across schooling and early learning. But it's important that there's also a transition period where the shift to the Equity Index is managed carefully." The target of free healthy lunches for a quarter of school children would increase the number from about 8000 to more than 200,000, he says. "Free lunches in schools, rolling out to 200,000 kids is a really big step, it's going to take quite a bit of work ... we're committed to doing because the feedback that we've had from the first round of schools who have taken part in the programme is it has made such a difference to kids learning. "They're just much healthier and much more engaged in their learning." Labour also pledges to "ensure all 17,000 teachers working in education and care centres are paid what they deserve". It will continue to work towards pay parity between teachers in education and care centres and their counterparts in schools and kindergartens. "We inherited a sector that was somewhat dispirited and in desperate need of some additional investment," he said. "We're here today at a community-based early childhood education service because we've got one big piece of unfinished business when it comes to early childhood education teacher pay and that's the issue of pay parity. "Teachers who are working in community based services like this one, private early childhood education services as well, they're not currently paid as well as the teachers working in kindergartens and that's because the government subsidies don't allow for that. "We've seen significant increases in funding for ECE (early childhood education), for all ECE. We're going to continue that investment." He says the coronavirus has not meant teaching te reo Mori in more schools has gone on the backburner. "If you look at the investment we've had in te reo Mori, if anything we've ramped it up as a result of Covid-19. We've been training over 1000 - I think it might even be getting up towards 2000 - additional te reo Mori teachers during our time that we've been in government ... a lot of additional curriculum resourcing has been developed. "I've been really open about this, I would have loved to have learned te reo Mori when I was at school and I'm really disappointed that I didn't have that opportunity ... I'm embarrassed to say that I have not made any progress in that area, but I do think it is important. "It is one of the things that makes us unique as a country, it is our first language, and we should absolutely be investing in it." Yesterday, the National Party pledged a $1.9 billion education package if elected into government. Hipkins says National's plans are similar to what Labour has already been implementing in its first term. "We've been putting extra money into counselling services and mental health support in schools because we know that makes a big difference, we have put more money into things like sign language, english as a second language support. "Many families will say it's not the lack of support that's the problem, it's not being able to access it." He also touted learning support coordinators, teacher and teacher aide pay increases, and increasing numbers of teacher aides. Barnados Early Learning general manager Joanna Lambert says it is good to see Labour's focus on pay parity in its education announcement. "At the moment, teachers in early learning settings are being paid considerably less than their counterparts in the primary sector or with kindergartens and there really is no justification for it. They do the same job, they work the same hours - in fact our teachers work longer hours than in kindergarten yet they receive less money because the government chooses not to fund us, or government has chosen not to fund us to the level that is needed," she says. "So we think it's important that all people working in early learning... are treated fairly, and treated the same for the jobs they do." Lambert said policy like the one being announced by Labour was necessary to make sure there were enough people working in the sector. "At the moment, with the shortage in the workforce that we have, it wouldn't be possible to achieve that. "It's an important part of the government achieving its strategy of 100 percent qualified [early learning staff] to ensure that children are getting best possible learning outcomes." Barnados hopes all political parties will take on a policy of pay parity for early learning teachers. "This isn't just about Labour's policy, it's about all political parties getting behind the early learning sector and recognising the extremely important part it plays in children's early development." New Zealand Union of Students national president Isabella Lenihan-Ikin says Labour's plan to not extend its fees-free plan for second and third-year tertiary students is "really disappointing". "This was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a publicly funded education system at the tertiary level, and to bring primary, secondary and tertiary sectors into alignment. I think it is even more disappointing in a time of economic recession, when we know that education will be such a valuable and important piece of the Covid recovery, that the government are not seeing that. "The fact that they are funding vocational training and apprenticeships and removing the cost of study in that particular sector recognises that they ideologically agree that the cost of tertiary education is a barrier to access education, so it is really disappointing that they are not seeing that we have to do that across the board in order to give students choice and freedom about what they study..." She says not everyone wants to study a trade or take vocational training, and adds that some important courses of study - like nursing and teaching - are not getting "the support from the government they need to keep going". In addition, students are one of the most vulnerable groups in society when it comes to borrowing to live, Lenihan-Ikin says. "We are experiencing a student debt crisis at the moment because student debt has reached $16 billion. The government has the ability to control that debt by funding tertiary education, and today they have totally missed the mark." Labour's shelving of any plans to re-introduce post-graduate student allowances also disappointed Lenihan-Ikin. "Two-thirds of students... go into increased debt to get by week to week. What we have seen by the failure to deliver on the post-graduate allowance is that even more students will continue to take on debt." She says all students should be supported, especially in a recession.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426084/national-announces-30m-childhood-dental-services-policy|2020-09-15|National is promising to spend an extra $30 million on improving dental services for children, including a free toothbrush, toothpaste and information pack each year. Missed the announcement? Watch it back here: Party leader Judith Collins, health spokesperson Shane Reti and National's Whanganui MP Harete Hipango announced the MySmile Tamariki Niho Ora policy in Whanganui today. The policy would include: National says the $30m will increase funding for childhood dental services by 30 percent, up from $100m, and is expected to net five times the benefit compared to the cost. The party says it would involve increased resources for paediatric and school dental services and an education drive. "There are currently 120,000 Kiwi kids on dental waiting lists," Collins says. "We will provide the resources to ensure children most at need can get the access to quality dental care they deserve." "Dental health to me is a really important thing for children and actually adults too. And we often meet people who have had poor dental health ... it holds them back forever if they can't stop that continuing. "I've also thought ... one of the really hard things for people who are dealing with having lost some of their teeth or all of their teeth is dealing with stigma around that but also around confidence levels. "It holds them back from being part of the economy, being in jobs, holds them back from taking opportunities that other people have and this is a really sensible way of dealing with - excuse the pun - the root of the issue." The free dental healthcare pack was based on a model introduced in Scotland in the 2000s, where tooth decay in five-year-olds decreased from 42 percent of children in 2008 - before the programme - to 32 percent in 2014. Dr Reti says the programme will involve supervised brushing. "What they've done in Scotland is for the three to five year olds, they have volunteers or school teachers who on a daily basis supervise effective tooth-brushing. For the older age group, they actually bring in dental therapists for the eight to 13 [year olds] and they actually supervise daily tooth-brushing." He says the party is hoping to roll the programme out to at least 100,000 children in the first year, eventually increasing to 500,000. "All New Zealand children should have access to the resources they need to have good oral health," Dr Reti says. "Regardless of income, background or postcode, we're giving children who might have otherwise missed out an opportunity for quality dental care." Collins says she does not see a case for banning fizzy drinks, advocating instead for flouridated water. "What I see is far better education for parents about what is actually in the fizzy drinks that their kids are drinking. I also think it's really important that we have if possible flouridated water, I'm very fond of flouridated water, I've seen the difference between my son's teeth and my teeth at that same age. "Children's teeth do need to have some help and that help is flouridated water." The party says families, schools and kindergartens will have the option to opt out of the policy. "We have been calling for increased funding for community oral health for a few years now so we are really pleased that the National party has put this into their policy." "The community oral health service has certainly been really severely impacted by covid ... we already had a number of children overdue for their recalls and with Covid having shut down particularly Auckland twice, the number of children overdue for treatment has just escalated this year so it's a real problem." She said more needed to be done for adults too, but NZDA understood the Covid-19 pandemic had changed things. "In an ideal world we'd definitely like to see funding for adults too because we've been asking for this for adults too and we've shared some suggestions for how that could be achieved. "We do understand that Covid has changed priorities somewhat and there isn't going to be enough money for everything so this is a really good step in the right direction." New Zealand Dental Association president Katie Ayers welcomed the policy. "We have been calling for increased funding for community oral health for a few years now so we are really pleased that the National party has put this into their policy. "The community oral health service has certainly been really severely impacted by Covid ... we already had a number of children overdue for their recalls and with Covid having shut down particularly Auckland twice, the number of children overdue for treatment has just escalated this year so it's a real problem." She said more needed to be done for adults too. "In an ideal world, we'd definitely like to see funding for adults too, because we've been asking for this for adults too and we've shared some suggestions for how that could be achieved." Funding for urgent dental grants should be doubled, the age of free dental care should be increased from 18 to 24 for people on a benefit, and research should be done to explore funding options for different communities, she says, and failure to do so would not be pretty. "It's just more of the same really, more adults in pain, more adults with missing teeth, more adults presenting to emergency departments, more adults being admitted to hospital and sometimes even intensive care due to the severity of their dental infection. "It's essentially all preventable ... we understand the only way to get traction and raising the profile of oral health is to do it through the parties and so that's what we've been really concentrating on the past couple of years. "We do understand that Covid has changed priorities somewhat and there isn't going to be enough money for everything so this is a really good step in the right direction." Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern says New Zealand already has elements of public health campaigns and provision of toothbrushes and toothpaste. "Yes, those are all things that we have elements of now and actually the Ministry of Health have been working on to extend as well." "One thing I would say is you name an area of health and it would have been an area that we are working to rebuild. Making sure that we're funding Pharmac to provide really necessary pharmaceutical products, rebuilding our hospitals ... there has been high need in health and dental is one of them but we need to prioritise. "Anyone in our government will admit that it is prohibitively expensive dental care, and that is why it is one of those areas we have been looking at what can we do to improve access and remove barriers, because I do accept it's an area that needs work." She says the government wants to avoid cuts in health and education. "That we still see the funding we need to keep services operating well ... we do want to maintain the quality of care New Zealanders have come to expect."

But it's not just Labour and National presenting their plans - The Outliers striving for a place in Parliament want to make radical changes to the pandemic recovery plan, while others don't want one at all. RNZ politics reporter Katie Scotcher hit the road to meet The Outliers and hear about their Covid-19 recovery plans. Billy Te Kahika's New Zealand Public Party thinks the government's pandemic response is worse than the coronavirus itself. It wants to ban lockdowns, repeal the Covid-19 Public Health Response Act, and protect only vulnerable citizens. Te Kahika and his followers believe the government is in cahoots with Bill Gates and is using the pandemic to strip people of their rights. His conspiracy theories, which he shares in live online videos, completely contradict official, science-based advice. "It's going to come to light that the information that our government is working on is faulty, it's wrong, it's incorrect," Te Kahika says. "People were saying back then 'oh you're just crazy, you're a conspiracy theorist', hey presto." The government's go hard and early elimination strategy would be eliminated itself if the New Conservatives are elected. Party leader Leighton Baker wants the country to instead move towards minimising and containing the spread of Covid-19. "We can't eliminate Covid, we've been trying, we've spent tens of billions of dollars to eliminate something we can't and now we've got this massive debt," Baker says. "Covid will continue to come back. Then what happens if it comes back a fourth or fifth time and you haven't got the money to spend what we've done before. "All we've done is really delay Covid going through New Zealand, so we need to be looking at minimisation." Mori Party co-leader John Tamihere wants the focus to shift from getting rid of the virus to strengthening New Zealand's borders. "Prior to anyone arriving here they've got to show that they've had a negative test three days prior. They have a test once they arrive ... then they've got to self-isolate for 14 days," Tamihere says. "If they've come from a country where the outbreak is quite rabid and not in a containment mode, well then they go into quarantining." Co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer says her party would ensure Mori are involved in the pandemic response, not left behind. "We would've made sure that those who led the Covid-19 responses within their regions were connected and engaging regularly with those who are making decisions, that the decision makers included representatives and advisors who had reach within these communities, not just the likes of Heather Simpson," Ngarewa-Packer says. "We would make sure that any recovery strategy, including economic, had a really good connect with the community so we didn't see mistakes as we saw with huge investment in Green School." Vision New Zealand doesn't have a clear Covid-19 strategy and its immigration and border policies are murky. But its leader Hannah Tamaki suggests she would only allow some New Zealanders living overseas to return home during lockdowns. "During this crisis everything should've just been put on hold. I'm not saying never, but during this crisis, the best thing we could've done is look after our own first and that's what I would've done," she says. The party also wants travellers to return a negative test before boarding their plane to New Zealand and to be tested again when they arrive in the country, before entering customs. A proud economist, Opportunities Party leader Geoff Simmons' main focus is boosting the battered economy. His party wants to abolish provisional tax and give cash to small businesses to help them take up digital technology, as well as invest in local government infrastructure. Simmons is happy with how the government has handled the Covid-19 crisis, although admits there are a few things he would change. "Having our quarantine facilities in our largest economic centre is downright reckless," Simmons says. "We need to be urgently looking at alternatives to site our quarantine and to allow that to scale up massively and to help pay for that, we need to be charging foreigners." While Covid-19 is expected to stick around for some time, there's little chance The Outliers will get an opportunity to implement their plans, with no one polling close to the magic 5 percent threshold needed to enter Parliament.

This series is exactly as its name suggests - perfect for those with a light appetite for politics or just a short attention span. Party leaders are limited to the length of an elevator ride to explain why they deserve your vote. In this episode, Winston Peters went to the top in one of the Beehive's many lifts pitching New Zealand First as the party of promises. He said no other party had kept promises like it had, over a length of 50 years. Peters said their party's experience was essential amid the others with extremes. "What's needed is a party of common sense and experience in the middle." But the veteran politician, well known for his bottom lines, was hard pushed to choose just one policy he is not willing to negotiate on. However, he is quick to poach an MP from another party. National Party leader Judith Collins has already taken the journey up, and has dibs on a Green Party MP The Elevator Pitch is a five-part series where leaders of the main parties pitch why someone should vote for them in the time it takes to ride the elevator.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426064/mandatory-climate-related-financial-disclosure-proposed|2020-09-15|New Zealand would be the first country to require the financial sector to report on climate risks under a new government regime. Climate Change Minister James Shaw. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Climate Change Minister James Shaw announced the proposed mandatory climate-related financial disclosure system this morning. Shaw said in a statement the new regime will be on a comply-or-explain basis based on the task force on climate-related financial disclosures framework. Businesses covered by the requirements would have to make annual disclosures, covering governance arrangements, risk management and strategies for mitigating any climate change impacts. If businesses were unable to disclose, they must explain why. If the system was approved by Parliament, financial entities could be required to make disclosures in 2023 at the earliest. About 200 organisations will be required to disclose their exposure to climate risk. This included large Crown Financial Institutions, such as ACC and the NZ Super Fund. Shaw said this was another step the government was taking towards a low carbon future for New Zealand and a cleaner, safer planet for future generations. "Many large businesses in New Zealand do not currently have a good understanding of how climate change will impact on what they do. "What gets measured, gets managed - and if businesses know how climate change will impact them in the future they can change and adopt low carbon strategies. Covid-19 has highlighted how important it is that we plan for and manage systemic economic shocks - and there is no greater risk than climate change," he said. Shaw said New Zealand would be the first country to implement such a system. "Australia, Canada, UK, France, Japan, and the European Union are all working towards some form of climate risk reporting for companies, but New Zealand is moving ahead of them by making disclosures about climate risk mandatory across the financial system," he said. The new climate reporting requirements will apply to: The $1b threshold will make sure about 90 percent of assets under management in New Zealand are included within the disclosure system. The External Reporting Board (XRB) will develop one or more reporting standards, which entities may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain why not. The Financial Markets Authority will be responsible for independent monitoring, reporting and enforcement.

Jami-Lee Ross will not contest the Botany seat. Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook He will be on the Advance New Zealand Party list. The former National MP merged his Advance NZ party with the Public Party in July, in the hope its leader, Billy Te Kahika, will win the seat of Te Tai Tokerau and enter Parliament. He said Advance NZ was tapping in to "growing voter dissatisfaction with the current main parties" and would be "competitive on October 17". Ross told RNZ Morning Report's Susie Ferguson the reason was because his party co-leader Billy Te Kahika was on track to win Te Tai Tokerau, and denied it was because of polling showing he was unlikely to win the seat. "We had to decide which one of us should focus on running the nationwide campaign, which one should focus on the seat. I'm running the nationwide campaign and Billy's gonna win [Te] Tai Tokerau. "It was looking like a three-way race. The Labour candidate's doing well, the national party's a lot lower than they were in 2017 and I certainly have a profile as the incumbent MP. "It was a situation where I couldn't focus on running an election campaign in a marginal seat, and also running a nationwide campaign. Billy Te Kahika will be winning Tai Tokerau so that was the best decision in terms of getting our policies and our platform into Parliament this election." The poll taken in August showing his numbers at 2 percent was not to be believed, he said. Asked if it was wrong, he would not say, but maligned the accuracy of his former party's numbers. "That is the National Party, you can't believe their misinformation, come on, that's ridiculous ... I'm saying that's the National Party's own personal polling, you can't listen to anything they say. When they go and put all of their internal polls out for everyone to garner, then fine." Asked what his party's own polling showed however, he did not seem to have an accurate number either and confirmed his party had not done its own polling. "My poll, having been the MP there for 10 years and knocking on doors was that it was a three-way race between myself, National and the Labour campaign." Ross has been in Parliament since 2011 when he won the the Botany by-election. He resigned from National in 2018, and said he would stand as an independent in any Botany by-election, after falling out with the party leadership. Ross and three businessmen are to stand trial over two $100,000 donations paid to the National Party - all have pleaded not guilty. Ross and Te Kahika organised a large rally in Auckland at the weekend protesting at the government's use of lockdowns and other Covid-19 restrictions. Several thousand people packed into Aotea Square with no social distancing and few wearing masks. Te Kahika has a growing following and has gained traction through the sharing of conspiracy theory videos online. Ross was confident Te Kahika would win the Te Tai Tokerau seat. "Te Tai Tokerau wants a voice that will stand up and fight for them, if they vote for Billy Te Kahika they'll still get Kelvin Davis on the list. Also that seat has a history of backing fighters, for half the time we've had MMP they've had a non-Labour MP and they want someone who will fight for them because Kelvin Davis has delivered nothing. "The reach we're getting on social media is ensuring that New Zealanders are getting out there and listening to an alternative point of view." He denied that 'alternative point of view' was conspiracy theories, and asserted that the Covid-19 case fatality rate was "nowhere near as high as we were first told".

OceanaGold's open pit mine at Macraes. Photo: SUPPLIED The company has extended the mine's life at least until 2028, and increased the estimate of reserves. "Macraes continues to be the mine that keeps on giving," OceanaGold chief executive Michael Holmes said. He said the mine's commercial life and output is being extended by further underground mining and opening up of more open cast operations. Holmes said the mine's proven and probable gold reserves had been increased by 240,000 ounces, and it expected to produce about 1.1 million ounces at an average cost of $US1,025 an ounce. It has produced more than 5-million ounces during its lifetime. World gold prices have surged during the pandemic as investors have sought the metal as a safe haven during the economic downturn and market volatility, hitting a record high of $US2,072 in August. "The updated Macraes Technical Report ... together with the progress at Waihi, makes for an economically robust New Zealand business that we expect will generate significant free cash flows while still retaining considerable exploration potential," he said. Macraes also operates a gold mine in Waihi, which has been at the centre of a battle with conservationists, and exposed divisions within the government. The High Court this week cleared the sale of 178 hectares of land to be used by the company as a waste dump, after an initial rejection by Land Information Minister Eugenie Sage was overturned by Labour ministers Grant Robertson and David Parkers on economic benefits to the country. Environmental group Coromandel Watchdog unsuccessfully challenged the decision in the High Court. OceanaGold has clashed with conservationists over a permit to explore for gold in Coromandel.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426116/leader-interviews-james-shaw-and-marama-davidson-talk-wins-losses-and-challenges|2020-09-16|The Green Party is heading into the election with "no bottom lines", but first have to secure a place in the next Parliament. With Parliament dissolved and politicians hitting the campaign trail, RNZ presents a series of interviews with party leaders. James Shaw steadied the ship in 2017 when the dramatic departure of then co-leader Metiria Turei threatened to sink the party's campaign, at a time the Greens had their best shot at getting into government. Now he's in damage control once again after the Green School controversy blew up in his face, and once again just weeks out from the general election. Shaw and co-leader Marama Davidson now have to focus attention on their wins in government and convince enough voters to put them back there. Labour's dominance could yet be a blessing or a curse for the Greens; left leaning voters could look to back the Greens to avoid a majority government, or its popularity could help decimate the Greens' vote. Its advantage is the weakened position of New Zealand First as it too fights for its survival; there's no love lost between it and the Greens with the term ending in open hostility. The usually mild mannered Shaw has been happy to take off the gloves and trade verbal blows in recent months. It's the curse of the smaller party in government under MMP - retaining, let alone growing, support as they decouple from the main party and remind voters who they are and what they were able to achieve. Davidson says they were "encouraged" by their level of support as Parliament wound up, having "defied history for smaller political parties" in first term in government. Their staunch position on the climate, the environment and inequality is what people expect and what they brought to the government table, Davidson says. In the last two major television polls, released in July, the Greens were hovering around the 5 percent mark, the threshold needed to return to Parliament without an electorate seat. Those results were before the Green School controversy, and it's yet to be seen how that will impact the party's public support - if at all. Either way, there's more work to do, says Davidson: "We'd like to be very comfortable about our chances of getting better, not just the Parliament, but having enough to form a government because we know that transformational change is needed for the big crises that people are facing". "Well yes," says Shaw," but you always want more than that because the number of MPs that we have determines the number of ministers we can have in the next Parliament, the greater share of the government program that we can expect to be able to influence, and so on. "So it is one of those cases where the more, the merrier." Labour's worked with both New Zealand First and the Greens, and at times both relationships have been strained. Talk to senior Labour figures though and there'd be more of a willingness to get back into bed with the Greens; partly because there's more ideological alignment, but also they've just been easier to deal with. That is a double-edged sword, however, sometimes meaning the Greens lost out when it came to a knock-down policy fight within the Coalition. Davidson believes most voters don't want a one party, majority government, "to have and wield all the power". That extends to some Labour voters, she says, with a "definite cohort of that who know that it is the Greens who will push for further and faster action for the more transformative changes to take place." "So we're very clear that what we need to do as the Greens, regardless of any other political party, is really focus on people supporting our vision, putting up a good contest of ideas, how about that?" There have been Green wins, most notably the passage of the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act, setting goals for New Zealand and laying out a framework to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, action on banning plastics, and the ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration. While there were inevitable compromises with the Zero Carbon legislation and other policy responses like progressing the Emissions Trading Scheme, they are tangible wins to present to supporters that tick traditional Green boxes. There was also a 'Green' hand in many social policy areas: housing, welfare and resources for protections against domestic violence to name a few. More than "99 percent" of what the party achieved was outside of its confidence and supply agreement with Labour, says Shaw, and it is having a seat at the table that delivers the greatest advantage. But there are some clear areas where the Greens didn't get what they wanted, including light rail in Auckland, and a resolution on the Kermadecs marine sanctuary. His biggest regret was not being able to get a capital gains tax across the line, but no party in the government got everything on their wishlist, Shaw says. "And some of it's just circumstance, even in some of those areas where we haven't been able to tick it off there has been considerable progress... there's almost nothing that's in there that we would say that we haven't at least made some progress on." "There are absolutely no bottom lines" for the Greens if they end up around the negotiating table after the 17 October election, Davidson says. "We're being very clear about what our priorities are but we are not setting bottom lines... and again, it does come back to the amount of support we have, the amount of votes we have, and what our party decides to put us in the best political position. And that could [look] like a range of options." Davidson says that extends to not knowing at this stage exactly what ministerial positions they'd push for; "it's all very, very honestly dependent on the vote". Ministerial positions had to be considered in the broader context, says Shaw, so if for example, the only role on offer was deputy prime minister - "no, what point is that?" "The reason why we're here and the reason why we want to be in government is to be able to advance as much of the agenda that we lay out to the electorate as possible," he says. "And so, you know, particular jobs really are a function of what do we think is the most effective way to achieve change? That may be one of them, but we haven't even laid out our negotiation strategy yet." While there were no specific portfolios either leader would say they had their eye on, it's no secret the party's focus is on both the environment and social justice. Davidson names initiatives like the poverty action plan and the clean energy plan as priority areas, but notes there are many "intersecting portfolios". "Whether or not they have ministers or associate positions or delegations attached to them is still yet something to be worked out, but we are at least being very honest, very transparent about what our priorities will be, about what the outcomes are."

Photo: RNZ / Richard Tindiller Would one bottom line be a refusal to work with New Zealand First again? "That's a hypothetical," says Shaw, "because if you look at current polling, it's not a probability we're likely to have to deal with, but ultimately the constellation of parties that make up the government as a function of voters, so they actually decide and who we have to work with in government, and it's really up to them." But every scenario is different, he says, and has been considered as such. Would the Greens have "put their foot down" and refused to have worked with NZ First in a similar line-up to 2017? - no, says Shaw, because that would have meant supporting National into government. "And you've got to remember also the stuff that we have achieved as a function of being in this government, we have achieved together, right. All three parties of government have consented to everything that this government has done." Green Party co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone One dynamic that bubbles away within the Greens is the tension between the old school environmentalists, and the new school social justice warriors The tussle over the party's identity is not new and was also a feature of the co-leadership under Shaw and Turei. The election of Davidson as leader was a clear signal issues like poverty, inequality and the Treaty of Waitangi remained important to the membership, alongside the push for a cleaner, greener New Zealand. There've been low key but persistent efforts to make sure she gets airtime and a larger profile in line with her more well-established, and well known co-leader. Davidson has settled into her role, but has had a few bumps along the way; the public event where she repeatedly dropped the c-word to highlight violence and inequality for women, with families on a day out looking on. And more recently [https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018756671/james-shaw-backs-marama-davidson-s-tax-is-love-statement saying "tax is love"], when so many New Zealanders are under intense financial pressure. Shaw publicly backed Davidson, as she did when he's been under pressure over the Green School. Even if they weren't always thrilled by the other's actions, they said the right thing and avoided any public displays of internal tension. Davidson says her "tax is love" comment got a "bit of rark from some quarters" but explains what she meant: "How vital it is to have strongly funded public infrastructure to make sure that we are sharing the wealth among all of us rather than just a few, while many, many of us are missing out on some real basics of living a decent life." She recognises the words "triggered" some, but says she also heard back from "people also more likely to think about supporting us, they got it and they were like 'yeah, I'm a higher earning person, I'm a higher wealth person, and I absolutely want the country to tax me more', so there was also... that understanding". Shaw "thought it was funny" when asked if it was an expression he'd use. "It's one of the those phrases that floats around on Twitter... but it coins a phrase, and what it conveys is actually what we do in a civilised society to support each other," he says. "And right now, we're at a moment of extraordinary risk as a country, and as a community, and we need to look after each other." Shaw and Davidson represent the twin priorities of the party; he says they "obviously come from very different backgrounds, appeal to different communities", allowing them to engage with a much broader audience than a traditional one leader model. The key thing, he says, is the ability to work together; "and the kind of people you are, than necessarily the fact that you come from different backgrounds or anything like that. "And every caucus in every party has quite a lot of diversity, except for ACT, so the thing is, is to make sure that we're just well co-ordinated, and that we're pulling in the same direction," Shaw says. "If we were the same there wouldn't be much point having co-leaders." There will be situations where they say things the other wouldn't - "we know this," laughs Davidson, and that can garner some "short lived" media attention. "The main point is we back each other as part of a team, we back each other as part of a co-leadership team but actually, we are just part of a team of MPs." Why would anyone expect them to be so "Weetbix the same? I don't think that those expectations are what folk expect of us at all and we don't expect that of each other either".

The possible return of charter schools brings a back to the future aspect to National's education policy, the Principals' Federation says. Photo: 123RF National is promising a $1.9 billion education package over four years, with a focus on learning support, teacher aides, and new special character schools. It also signals investment in fast-growing state and state-integrated schools and more funding for secondary languages in primary and intermediate schools. The policy announcement has been met with mixed reactions but a general feel of disappointment from those working on the ground in the education sector. National Party leader Judith Collins discusses the new policy alongside the party's spokesperson on education, Nicola Willis. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas President of Te Akatea New Zealand Mori Principals' Association Myles Ferris said while there are some good aspects in the policy it doesn't invest in Mori children. "There's very, very little in it for Mori education that is of Mori, for Mori and by Mori. It looks like a very colonised policy that shows they think they know how to improve education for Mori but there's very little substance." Ferris said even te reo Mori - one of the country's three official languages - will have to compete for funding under the second languages part of the policy. He said the education system will continue to fail Mori until a "by Mori for Mori" approach is endorsed and funded by the government. New Zealand Principals' Federation president Perry Rush said a possible re-introduction of charter schools in New Zealand was a terrible idea. Charter schools - dubbed "new partnership schools" - would return under the National Party's education policy that set out an aim to establish 25 by the year 2023. Rush said the policy had a "back to the future mantra" and would be a huge step back for schooling; charter schools having been recently scrapped by the coalition government. "We don't like the idea of high performing schools being held up as some sort of high tide mark for other schools to aspire to because the last time National did this they imposed the national education standards in schooling and they proved to be one of the most destructive things to creative curriculum we've seen in a long time." He said the National Party should be focused on ensuring every child in public schooling gets a decent education. Early Childhood New Zealand chief executive Kathy Wolfe said the education policy is more of the same from the previous National government. She said it was deflating to search for investment in early childhood in the policy to find there is nothing new for the country's youngest learners. Wolfe added she's hoping pay parity will be prioritised in the Labour Party's education policy which is yet to be announced.

Photo: RNZ Pacific/ Koroi Hawkins Victoria University researchers Dr Mona Krewel and Professor Jack Vowles have joined a project monitoring social media during election campaigning, identifying fake news. Part of the challenge is to assess if techniques such as data mining or misinformation has intruded onto the campaign trail here as has been identified in some overseas elections and referenda. Dr Krewel told RNZ Morning Report's Corin Dann that, backed by an army of coders, they would be publishing findings on a weekly basis starting this week. "We have our coders and they have a huge thing which we call a codebook and they go through all the Facebook posts and have a definition of what fake news is. "We also ask the coders to fact check, so if they are not fully sure that something could be fake news we ask them to actually kind of Google this, go to traditional media, to reliable sources like your radio station for example, and look if this has already been called out as fake news." She said they had defined fake news as "stories that are completely or for the most part made up and intentionally and verifiably false to mislead voters". "On the fake news half-truth side, I would say it's mostly the New Zealand Public Party and New Conservatives that engage in a little bit of that." Many other metrics would also be examined, including looking at misinformation, negative versus positive campaigning, inclusion of Mori, and many more things, presented in interactive graphs. "If it's flying below the radar of fake news ... If it's not entirely or for the most part made up, does it still contain some half truths or somewhat questionable regarding its factual accuracy," Dr Krewel said. She says the coders are already training and have some initial results. "My current impression is that they are campaigning very fair ... a little bit of negative campaigning we are starting to see." She said New Zealand was a very different landscape than the US, and was more likely to see New Zealand-made fake news than high volumes of Russian bots and articles created by state actors. "It's definitely the other end ... I would imagine that for the US and particularly the upcoming presidential election we would see a very high bar for fake news and negative campaigning, this is also due to the electoral system, it's a two-party system so you have a clear antagonist who you attack, which is different from the multi-party system. "We still see high-quality democratic campaigning in New Zealand overall." Dr Krewel said this New Zealand project was based on the Campsource group that had followed other elections overseas, but would be different in that results would be published weekly during the election campaign, instead of afterwards.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425993/cabinet-extends-current-covid-19-alert-levels|2020-09-14|Cabinet will meet again on Monday to decide if gatherings in Auckland can be increased and whether or not the rest of the country can move to alert level 1. Missed the announcement? Watch it here: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says Cabinet has decided to extend the current alert levels. "On the advice of the director-general, Cabinet has decided on a short extension to the current restrictions of alert level 2.5 for Auckland and level 2 for the rest of the country." For Auckland, Cabinet will review the current level at a meeting on Monday 21 September with a view to increase gathering limits, depending on whether the cluster is contained. If that change is agreed on, it will come into force on 23 September, Ardern says. She says on Monday 21 September, Cabinet has agreed in principle that the rest of New Zealand will move to alert level 1 - contingent on cases tracking the way they are. The move will be confirmed on Monday. The level 2 precautions continue to act as a safety barrier against flare-ups for the rest of New Zealand, she says. She says it has been two weeks - one transmission cycle of the virus - since Auckland moved to level 2.5. "In that time, we have identified a further 36 cases in the community - all are associated with the wider Auckland cluster and most were people who had a known link to the cluster and so were already isolated." Ardern announced physical distancing requirements on planes and public transport will be eased from today. "From today, public transport operators, including airlines, buses and trains, do not need to maintain any seating restrictions or passenger capacity limits at level 2. Mask use will continue to be compulsory [on public transport at level 2 and higher]." On travelling and airport safety, Ardern says "what we want to see maintained by our airlines is enforcement of mask use because that has been a key part of the director-general's decision and advice ... what we want to see is that when we're loading passengers, making sure we're maintaining physical distancing for loading and disembarkation because that's where you start to see congestion." Labour Party finance spokesperson Grant Robertson said it was Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield's advice to remove social distancing on planes and public transport. "It was his recommendation. Clearly over time the advice in this area has evolved, where originally we were very focused on physical distancing, then when masks came along we [were] told we needed to keep both of them in play. The compliance with mask wearing has been excellent and the director-general's advice has evolved to now say he believes we can move forward," he said. "He has worked closely with Air New Zealand around their overall health and safety and making sure that they are doing all the right things to assure that safety, so this was in fact exactly his advice." Photo: RNZ / Nathan Mckinnon Ardern says Treasury's latest update shows economic activity across the Auckland region and the country bounced back to levels experienced under level 1. "This is a global pandemic and the global economic outlook is weak. "The best approach to a healthy economy is getting the virus under control. "Continuing our elimination strategy based on stronger more targeted public health measures allows economic activity in New Zealand to resume sooner than would otherwise be the case." She says the plan is working but just needs "a little more time". "My view is that we need to keep all of New Zealand safe. Modelling suggest there still is a risk that cases could still travel out of Auckland." Labour's coalition partner New Zealand First has invoked the agree-to-disagree policy in Cabinet. Party leader Winston Peters says Auckland should be at level 2 and the rest of the country at level 1. "There's not been a case in the South Island since April this year and round the rest of the country very similar results apart from four in Tokoroa and they were [contracted] all in Auckland. "This is costing hundreds and hundreds of millions ... every extra week that we're not required to do it." New Zealand First leader Winston Peters in Wairoa this afternoon. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers He says the information supplied by Dr Ashley Bloomfield does not justify the extension. "When you get hold of [the information] you'll see that it's not granularly sound in terms of the scientific sense. It is not consistent. There are all sorts of statements being made now that were not made way back when we did the first level shut downs. He says the decision to maintain alert levels is not consistent. "You're allowing Aucklanders to travel, so to speak, but everywhere else is shut down. How does that work?" He is not calling for a return to hard borders between Auckland and the rest of the country, however. "It's contradictory, and New Zealanders know it ... our proposal was and always has been the case before we went into lockdown at the very beginning was to get the military involved and ensure you had the resources to do the job properly including masks. None of this was done ... we said from the very beginning there was no need for [the rest of New Zealand] to go out of lockdown 1 in the first place, and the evidence has been proven that we were correct when we said that." Masks should also be worn in places where there is risk, he says. National Party leader Judith Collins, speaking at an education policy announcement this afternoon, says the alert level moves are starting to look "very political". "We're starting to wonder very much because we don't get the same advice the prime minister has and she doesn't share it ... I'm feeling they're starting to get a bit political. "In Auckland, campaigning is reduced to essentially handing out pamphlets and ... doing things on social media because there's only 10 people in a room, so it's very tough. But when the going gets tough the tough get going, so we do. National Party leader Judith Collins this afternoon. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "I think it's very clear that this is now a political decision that we're seeing." She says she wants Ardern to front up and "explain exactly how the decisions are made and how they differ or not with the advice that they're getting". "We'd just like the government to get their act together ... too frightened to do anything so does nothing." She says she sees no reason why the South Island should be at the level it is at the moment. Peters echoed that sentiment. "We're not pleased, we're out there campaigning in the most impossible circumstance and we're looking at the economic and health analysis and we don't agree with that. "A lot of people are starting to ask me 'why are you guys trying to shut down a proper campaign, are you part of this design', and I'm saying most certainly we are not." He would not say it was a stitch-up by Labour, but that he would have thought there would be far more analysis on the health statistics and "so-called modelling". "On what is it based? Where is the international evidence that this is going to work? I think people are entitled to know that because their economic lives and their jobs and their business futures massively hinge upon this." He says the decision is "far too reliant on so-called experts". ACT party leader David Seymour says the extra week of higher Covid-19 alert levels shows it "cannot be true that this government is competently managing Covid-19. "They cannot say on the one hand they are managing it successfully and on the other hand we must continue with restrictions due to a single initial outbreak," Seymour says. "The level of risk the country is able to take depends on the competency of the government's contact tracing and obviously the fact that we can't take any risk shows we don't have gold standard contact tracing to get on top of outbreaks, and so are condemned to lengthy and expensive lockdowns that are devastating New Zealanders' livelihoods in some sectors... "The South Island has had no cases of Covid-19 for 42 days and yet they still find themselves under restrictions simply because the government's contact tracing is so poor they can't afford to risk a single outbreak." He had heard from businesses that they "understood the first lockdown, they endured the second, but they cannot make money under these restrictions because of the reduced activity." "It's almost worse than being shut for many businesses," he says. The government's response had not been nimble enough to deal with the "realities of balancing economic and health prerogatives in an efficient way". As for New Zealand First's position to "agree to disagree" with the alert level extension, Seymour says: "If New Zealand First wanted to have an impact on the management of Covid they have had many opportunities to do it over six months, but there was no election then. Now there's an election, but it's too late to make a difference to New Zealanders' welfare". There was one new case of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand today, and updates were provided about the infected health worker who works at the Jet Park quarantine facility in Auckland. Yesterday it also emerged that a person visited Les Mills gym in Takapuna while infectious, and that there 89 people considered to be close contacts. Ardern confirmed the person who went to Les Mills worked at a managed isolation facility. "That individual works in a managed isolation facility ... and in the facility that we have been keeping people who from the Auckland cluster have Covid-19. So as a health worker that's being exposed to those who have been in quarantine rather than having picked it up in the community. That's the link." She says that case and its close contacts are being well managed. She says people working in quarantine facilities have been asked to keep a strict log of their whereabouts and who they come in contact with, and also tracking their symptoms. On sport, Ardern says "for games between New Zealand and Australia, that is a different risk profile for teams from Australia, than for instance for teams from South Africa and Argentina, where for instance we have already had team members test positive for Covid". "I do believe we can find a workable solution so we can make the Bledisloe Cup happen." She says New Zealanders are capable to engage in the elections and attend the Bledisloe Cup, if it were to be held on 17 October. "We are able as a nation to accommodate both a ruby game and an election." Collins says the government has "stuffed up" the SANZAAR rugby championships and will probably lose hosting for the Bledisloe Cup. "Because they couldn't organise themselves. We had on one side the Australians able to work out how to make things work and we have our government incapable of how to make something work. I'm not surprised by that, I'm just constantly floored that other people ever think that these guys could do anything. "I'm just disgusted by it, that they can't get rugby games here, because they can't even organise how the Australians are doing it," she says. "The rugby union's been very clear, it's not SANZAAR politics, it's Labour Party politics." Auckland has been at a tailor-made alert level 2.5 since 31 August, as a step down from level 3 restrictions. It limits the number of people allowed at gatherings to no more than 10, while outside of Auckland gatherings of up to 100 are allowed. The rest of the country has been at alert level 2.

New students who start studying with New Zealand institutions from overseas should also be eligible for work rights, an education provider says. Photo: 123RF Quality Tertiary Institutions said the move would encourage more students to enrol with New Zealand education providers while the borders remained closed. It included the call in a manifesto of policies it wanted to see from the parties contesting next month's election. Foreign students could get a work visa for up to three years if they had studied a certificate or diploma for 60 weeks, or a degree or higher qualification for at least 30 weeks - but only if they studied in New Zealand. The executive director of Quality Tertiary Institutions, Tommy Honey, said that was not fair for international students who were half-way through their degrees but stuck overseas and studying online because of the pandemic. He said they deserved the same work rights as a student studying in New Zealand. "We've really got to help those people out," he said. "Learning offshore online shouldn't impact on their rights to what's called a post-study work visa." He said new students who started studying from overseas now should also be eligible for work rights. Honey also said Immigration New Zealand should resume study visa applications from people who were based overseas because the current pause on accepting applications was sending the wrong message. "That's actually like pinning the closed sign on the door, rather than 'back in five minutes'. We've got to really think about the messaging we've got out there." Other parts of the private sector were also keen for the government to restart study visa applications for overseas applicants and provide certainty about when foreign students could return. The chairperson of English New Zealand, Darren Conway, said accepting visa applications would keep foreign students interested in New Zealand and help avoid bottle-necks of applications when the border did reopen. Meanwhile, he said the organisation's members desperately needed support from the government's $10 million fund for private tertiary institutions that had lost at least half of their foreign enrolments because of the pandemic. Applications to the fund closed on Friday and Conway said most language schools would not survive into next year without its support. The chairperson of Independent Tertiary Education New Zealand, Craig Musson, said some of its 140 members were also hoping for support from the fund. However, he said they were not confident of success. "The criteria was very, very tight. Bit of a blunt instrument to be honest and there'll be many that won't meet the criteria and will struggle going forward. Some may end up closing if they don't get this fund," he said. However, Musson said other private providers were doing well because their domestic enrolments had increased. He said the increase included students who had left school early because of the disruption to their studies caused by the pandemic.

A banner outside Parliament during te wiki o te reo Mori - Mori language week - in 2019. Photo: RNZ / Richard Tindiller In an announcement today, the first day of te wiki o te reo Mori, Waiariki candidate Rawiri Waititi said it was a bold move towards making te reo Mori a language for all of Aotearoa. "It is unacceptable that only 20 percent of our people can speak their own language and that only 3 percent of the country can speak its official language. We need to be doing more at a systemic level to protect and promote the reo of Aotearoa," Waititi said. The Mori Party also aims to establish a Mori Standards Authority which will have legislative power to audit all public service departments against cultural competency standards. Other parts of the policy include requiring all state funded media broadcasters to have a basic fluency of te reo Mori if they wish to continue working in the industry. "Wakatanay (Whakatne) and Wongarey (Whangrei) are no longer acceptable over the media air waves. We expect better," Waititi said. Its policy includes: Te Pti Kkriki (the Green Party) also used today as an opportunity to call on the government to step up their game on their commitment to te reo Mori. It is calling for te reo Mori to be made a core school subject up to Year 10. Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson says the government must make te reo Mori a core curriculum subject if it is serious about integrating te reo Mori into schools by 2025. Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone The Green Party wants te reo Mori to be universal in schools by 2030 - which it says was developed with Mori educators, language experts, and teacher unions. "We recognise that teaching te reo widely will require more teachers. That's why we want te reo Mori courses, up to level five, added to the list of subjects in the Targeted Training and Apprenticeships Fund," Davidson says. "This would mean people who lost jobs due to Covid-19 could retrain, with the aim of eventually teaching te reo Mori. They could also apply those skills to mahi throughout the public and private sector." Although she is pleased Labour is on board with making Matariki a public holiday, Davidson wants the government to show a commitment to protecting tikanga Mori by going a step further and agreeing to add it to the core curriculum. Maihi Karauna is the Labour Party's strategy, with the goal of achieving 1 million te reo Mori speakers by 2040. "This government is committed to recognising tikanga, mtauranga and te reo Mori as part of New Zealand's national identity - it is what makes us unique. Making New Zealand history compulsory in schools, support for Te Ptake o te Riri and initiatives like this demonstrates this commitment to strengthening as a country," says the party's spokesperson for Mori development, Nanaia Mahuta.

There was $108.4m set aside in this year's budget to expand delivery of Te Ahu o te Reo Mori nationwide over the next four years. Labour party deputy leader Kelvin Davis says: "This will strengthen the capability and confidence of up to 40,000 of our education workforce to successfully integrate te reo Mori into all students' learning. "Initiatives like Te Ahu o te Reo Mori, along with the $230m increased support for Khanga Reo in the last two Budgets, reinforce this government's commitment to revitalising te reo Mori."

Missed the policy announcement? Watch it back here: In an announcement at Graduate School of Education this afternoon, party leader Judith Collins and education spokesperson Nicola Willis say the party, if elected, would prioritise "lifting achievement for all New Zealand children, no matter their background or ability". They announced $1.9bn in new policies: Collins says National would increase education spending every year, including increased operational funding for schools and early childhood education services. "Parents want to see their children grow and thrive, to have options and opportunities once they leave school. We understand this, and a National Government will invest in the future of our children," she says. National Party leader Judith Collins with education spokesperson Nicola Willis. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "What is really important too is that we focus on the fact that we need more teachers. "Under the current part-time minister of education, what we're seeing is a return to the future, a return to big unionism, big focus on what big government wants and actually a stifling of individuality and excellence." Collins says the party hopes children will make use of the funding for students to learn a second language. This week is te wiki o te reo Mori, which celebrates and promotes learning te reo Mori, and Collins says that she hopes many children - though kohanga reo - will also make te reo Mori their first language. Collins says the country will not be officially renamed Aotearoa while she is prime minister, however. "It's New Zealand, and I'm very happy to have it also called Aotearoa but I am very focused on New Zealand and New Zealanders ... I just think we focus on the economy and we get on and we get on and get people into work and we build a future." Willis says investing in teacher aides would make a big difference. "Parents and teachers alike know how valuable it is to have an extra pair of hands and eyes in the classroom," she says. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas She says one-in-five children need extra support for learning, disability, behavioural, health and other challenges, and the party had developed a plan to reduce the barriers they faced. This plan would include: Collins says children with additional learning needs can get left behind, "depending on the school and depending on the teacher". "We know there are some schools where children with additional learning needs feel more welcome, are more able to succeed than other schools ... and some feel unwanted at their school. "Rather than making this a problem for the child, or the parent, we're going to give parents a choice when it comes to school zoning, we're not going to be the rigid Labour government on this. "It's a bit of freedom and by the way it's got a great reason for us doing it." Collins repeatedly praised the new policies. "I'm happy to support this policy as the best education policy I've ever seen." The party has previously announced it plans to build at least 25 new partnership schools by 2023, with some focused on specific groups like Mori, Pasifika, children with additional needs and schools focused on specialised education like science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). Collins says partnership schools were "one of the great successes of the [previous] National-led government". "Labout came into office, they said that they didn't like partnership schools, they got rid of them and they called the ones that they left 'special character schools'. "We know that they're partnership schools. We want to make sure that we celebrate partnership schools and what they can do for young people, particularly those who are left out of the education system ... I know they work in my electorate, many of us have seen them working and in fact they work really really well." The announcement was on top of $4.8 billion in extra spending on school infrastructure, and other previously announced policies including reducing student-to-teacher ratios in primary schools, and establishing 25 new partnership schools by 2023 with some focused on specific groups.

Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas Transport spokesperson Chris Bishop released the party's Southern Transport Package in Dunedin this morning, with funding for projects across the wider Southern region totalling $140 million in new spending. Bishop says safety improvements are at the core of National's southern transport plans, with spending on passing lanes, road and bridge upgrades a focus. Rail, cycleways and bridge replacement will also be explored. Bishop says the party intends to fast-track work on State Highway 1 between Mosgiel and Balclutha, and work with Dunedin City Council and Mosgiel-Taieri Community Board on a heavy traffic bypass for Mosgiel. "Traffic on State Highway 1 between Mosgiel and Balclutha has increased approximately 13 percent in the past four years," he says. "Between 2006 and 2015, 12 people were killed and 66 were seriously injured in crashes on this stretch of road. Bishop says the party would put $10 million towards a walking and cycling trail, and $100,000 to fund a feasibility study to explore commuter rail between Dunedin and Mosgiel. "If the results are robust and warrant further investigation then National will fund up to $300,000 through NZTA for a limited trial of the service, working with KiwiRail to make it happen," he says. Bishop says a train route to Mosgiel makes sense. "If you work here in the Dunedin CBD and you live in Mosgiel, rather than getting into your car you will have a, you know, potentially you will have a transport option of getting on the train in the morning and going home again in the evening. "That's not only great for the environment but it's also great for congestion on that route. Bridges across the wider region would also get some attention, with Bishop saying National would direct the Transport Agency (NZTA) to work with Southland District Council on a systematic upgrade programme. He says 171 of Southland's 850 bridges need replacement within the next 12 years. "Little funding has been allocated and planning needs to begin now." It would include funding and fast-tracking of a replacement for Beaumont Bridge over the Clutha River, connecting Dunedin with Queenstown and Central Otago. The Orari Bridge in Geraldine will also be double-laned and upgraded, he says. The party will also "immediately begin work" on passing lanes and safety improvements on the road between Queenstown and Te Anau, he says, "a critical connector for tourists visiting the region".

Billy Te Kahika addresses a rally in Aotea Square in Auckland on Saturday. Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson Billy Te Kahika, leader of the NZ Public Party, Advance NZ co-leader and Te Tai Tokerau candidate, has a growing following - gaining traction through the sharing of conspiracy theory videos online. He caused even more controversy over the weekend after he and Jami-Lee Ross organised a large rally in Auckland; at least a few thousand people packed into Aotea Square with no social distancing and few wearing masks. The police chose not to intervene and enforce alert level two rules saying that would have risked raising tensions in an otherwise peaceful protest. But Te Kahika's style and message are attracting many Mori voters - one researcher believes he is taking advantage of their distrust of the government for his own political gain. RNZ political reporter Katie Scotcher hit the road to meet The Outliers and spoke to the controversial candidate. It's a sunny morning in Whangrei and a large crowd is gathering at a small cafe in the town's centre. Word quickly spread on social media Billy Te Kahika would be here - an opportunity for supporters to meet him and his family. Soon a large, predominantly Mori, crowd is crammed inside and spills out to the pavement - social distancing non-existent and not a mask in sight. Te Kahika is hospitable; offering hugs and cups of tea to his supporters before addressing them. Word spreads quickly on social media when Billy Te Kahika is in town. Photo: RNZ His followers seem entranced by the charismatic leader's every word. Many livestream the casual gathering on social media and Te Kahika takes advantage of the opportunity to spread his message. "I've had pneumonia, I've had a collapsed lung, and I had pleurisy all at once. That's a respiratory illness as you know, it could've killed me. "I would be frightened of Covid-19 if I followed the data this government is sharing, I should be deadly worried about this, but I'm not. Why? Because I know that I'm fit. "My immune system is based of many things that keep me healthy and I'm not afraid of this disease. Why? Because the leading health organisations on the planet are saying that Covid-19 is a winter flu equivalent virus," Te Kahika told the crowd. But it's not - the scientific consensus is that Covid-19 is far more severe than the flu and incredibly contagious. It's a reality the government has been stressing. "Just look at what's happening internationally, you can see that this is very, very real. The virus is very, very deadly and there is no vaccine," Health Minister Chris Hipkins said. But this is all background noise to Te Kahika's supporters. One supporter, who asked not to be named, told RNZ he has never voted before, but will be supporting Te Kahika in the Te Tai Tokerau electorate. He described Te Kahika as an honest guy with integrity, qualities he said most politicians don't have. "They seem to be making a rad hysteria about a virus that doesn't seem to be causing that much of an effect on the health of people, no more different than the common winter flu ... do we believe the health officials?" he said. Another supporter, who also asked not to be named, is a long-time Labour supporter, but this year she's voting for Te Kahika. "He's here for not just one culture, but for all cultures, especially for the Te Tai Tokerau people ... he is right. We do need someone for us here," she said. Tina Ngata. Photo: Supplied Tina Ngata, a researcher and indigenous rights advocate, said it was not uncommon for Mori to support all minor parties, as they've been let down by successive governments. But Te Kahika is capitalising on this support for political gain and to spread his agenda, she said. "We have a history of being disenfranchised, we have a history of maltreatment and that's why people are feeling that they need to go for something different and that's why people feel suspicious as well," Ngata said. As Te Kahika continues to spread misinformation about Covid-19, Ngata is worried about what the consequences will be for Mori. Recent research shows the virus is far more likely to kill and hospitalise Mori if it isn't controlled. "I think it's easy to dismiss people who you don't personally take seriously, but if they do wind up having any kind of political influence the ramifications in this climate and in this context, with Covid-19 in particular, are disastrous," she said. It's extremely unlikely Te Kahika will make it to Parliament, but his partnership with former National MP Jami Lee Ross, increases the possibility ever so slightly. Ross' chances of retaining his staunchly National seat of Botany are also low, but his incumbency offers the alliance a miniscule opportunity - under the rules one seat in Parliament is enough.

This series is exactly as its name suggests - perfect for those, with a light appetite for politics, or just a short attention span. In this episode Judith Collins had the length of the elevator ride - in an actual moving elevator - to pitch the strengths of her party, as it bids to make it to the ninth floor. While travelling up and down in the black and white tiled lift in Parliament Buildings, she said in this election, the focus was people, and that's what sets them apart from the competition. "We believe in people, more than we believe in big government. "It's the people we should be there for, not the other way around." Collins also reveals her cartoon crush and who she would like to bring over to the National Party given the chance - the answer might surprise you. "I like that she's got challenging ideas, many of which I don't agree with, but I like to have people round me who don't necessarily agree with every single thing I say." - The Elevator Pitch is a five-part series where leaders of the main parties pitch why someone should vote for them in the time it takes to ride the elevator.

Stuart Crosby. Photo: RNZ/ Andrew McRae Figures from Statistics New Zealand showed nationwide, the total operating income for councils was $225 million less than in the previous quarter. It brings councils' revenue down to levels not seen since September 2018. They were particularly hit by a significant drop in sales and other operating income, which dropped from $480 million the previous quarter, down to $350 million this quarter. Local Government New Zealand president Stuart Crosby said the figures weren't a surprise, but it is did mean local authorities were having to stretch budgets as far as they would go. "What sources of revenue which have been reduced are often user fees and charges for various activities of councils," he said. "Some councils own businesses where they get dividends. Of course the activities have to keep going for most of them, so it's put a lot of pressure on councils' budgeting." While total investment income was up on the previous quarter, it was down by 45 percent on the previous year. "Those funding tools haven't changed in decades, and yet the operating environment that we're operating in is now a lot more complex. More and more roles are being put onto local government over the last thirty year," Crosby said. "Levels of service they have to deliver - drinking water standards, wastewater, transport, open spaces, park reserves, libraries etc. - all those costs are going up and yet the funding tools remain the same. "Covid-19 is going to articulate this even sharper as we move forwards."
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425911/election-2020-promises-what-happened-on-12-september|2020-09-12|Multiple promises have been made today by political parties in a bid to secure and appeal to more voters ahead of the general elections. Here are the main takeaways from today's developments. The Mori Party has announced plans to create an independent entity to take over the responsibility of Mori children in state care. Photo: Supplied This morning in Whangarei, the party announced plans to spend $600 million on a 'Mokopuna Mori Entity' which would be provided by Mori, for Mori, to Mori. The party's candidate for Te Taitokerau, Mariameno Kapa-Kingi, says Mori do not belong in generic state care, they belong within whnau, hap and iwi. Kapa-Kingi, who is a qualified social worker, told RNZ the current system was failing Mori. "Every mokopuna gets a pkeh response. You're speaking in pkeh, thinking in pkeh and the models being applied are pkeh. "We're smart people. We're smart Mori-thinking people. We know what's best for us. We do not need anyone non-Mori tell us what we need anymore. It's just our time." The party would also create a partnership network with Mori organisations as well as hap and iwi, to help children remain connected to their whakapapa. The Labour Party also unveiled its welfare plan - under which the training incentive allowance for higher skilled courses will be reinstated, and people on a benefit and working part-time will be able to earn more. Labour Party's social development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni. Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson Social development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni said this allowance was an investment in a family's future, and one that she herself had used in the past. "This support is critical to ensuring that our people continue to develop the skills needed for New Zealand's economic recovery and rebuild." People can get up to $112.89 a week, with a total maximum of $4515.60 a year, and it can be used alongside student loans and childcare assistance. It's targeted at sole parents, disabled people and their carers, and provides extra support towards the cost of study. The policy would cost about $431 million over four years, and about $187m in capital over 10 years and will be paid for out of the Covid Response and Recovery Fund. Labour would also increase abatement thresholds so people could earn more in part-time work - up to $160 a week, before their benefit is reduced, about eight hours on the minimum wage. At the moment benefits start reducing for any earnings over $90 a week for someone on Jobseeker support. The thresholds would also increase for Sole Parent Support the Supported Living Payment. The estimated cost is up to $320m over four years; additional costs of year-on-year increases in line with minimum wage were already committed in Budget 2019. The party's economic plan, which was also released today, is promising to progressively extend living wage guarantees to all public service contractors. Under the plan, public service contractors could earn almost an extra $100 per week, according to the party. It would start the extension of living wage guarantees with public service cleaners, caterers and security guards. The Green Party detailed its Farming for the Future plan today, consisting of an almost $300 million fund to support a move to more climate-friendly agricultural practices. Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson trying out the produce at an organic farm in Leeston on 12 September, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver The Healthy Food and Farming Fund would distribute up to $297m over three years towards the transition to regenerative and organic farming. It would be used for practical on-farm changes as well as processing infrastructure. The party said combined with the current government's $700m package of support for farmers to clean up waterways, this would provide $997m of funding support for clean farming. "Our Farming for the Future Plan supports farmers to be part of the solution to the climate crisis, by offering grants, loans, and other resources to support the transition to low-emissions farming," said co-leader James Shaw. The party would also look to make changes to the Organic Products Bill to "include a robust definition of organic, clarify that existing organic certifications are valid, and create an organic industry advisory group to oversee the legislation." Other initiatives in the plan include a government-backed sustainability accreditation system for food and fibre products, a levy on the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, a ban on the import and use of palm kernel extract (PKE) as supplementary feed, changing the rules around forestry and strengthening land use rules, funding for urban food gardens and community agriculture and working with tangata whenua to establish a resource rental on commercial use of water.

Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Under the plan, public service contractors could earn almost an extra $100 per week. It would start the extension of living wage guarantees with public service cleaners, caterers and security guards. It would also require agencies to include the payment of a Living Wage in new contracts as part of renegotiations. In a statement, Labour workplace relations and safety spokesperson Andrew Little says they plan to extend the Living Wage to core public sector contractors if elected, with "thousands" set to benefit from it. "Labour has always stood for fairness at work, high quality high wage jobs, and an improved quality of life for our workers. "That's why in 2018 we ensured that all employees in the core public service received at least the Living Wage, including full-time, part-time and casual employees, with 70 percent of those benefiting from the increase being women." That change in 2018 had not included contractors. Back in 2017, Labour had also campaigned on paying the living wage - first to core government workers, then rolling it out to contractors over time. Additionally, security guards contracted to the Ministry of Social Development are now being paid the Living Wage starting from this month, after an announcement from the party in August. Over time, this new plan would also be rolled out to contractors in the wider state service, such as DHBs, "as the Covid recovery allows", the party said. Little says the Covid-19 pandemic has particularly highlighted the importance of the work of people in the community, but they are not getting what they deserved. "We can do a lot better at lifting wages and easing financial stress for hard-working New Zealanders." Economic development spokesperson Phil Twyford says contracted employees help everyone to do their jobs. "Paying contracted workers a Living Wage will be a great boost to their household incomes and improve life for them and their families. This money will be spent back in the community, meaning it will benefit the wider economy at the same time." The party expects the policy would cost $18 million per year for cleaners, caterers and security guards once fully rolled out. The Living Wage is currently $22.10 per hour and is calculated independently each year by the New Zealand Family Centre Social Policy Unit, taking into account basic expenses such as food, transport, housing and childcare.

Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson trying out the produce at an organic farm in Leeston on 12 September, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver If elected, the Green Party wants to establish a $297 million fund to help farmers transition to regenerative and organic farming. The party also wants a levy on the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, phasing in stronger limits in the freshwater standards, to progressively reduce nitrogen pollution. The announcement was made today at Logan Kerr and Dominique Schacherer's organic farm in Leeston. Kerr and Schacherer's farm is about 20 hectares, where they grow salad greens, potatoes, beetroot, onions, carrots and "basically everything that can grow in the climate around Canterbury." Kerr says it is fantastic that support may finally be given to those who want to farm organically. "It's an extremely difficult thing to get into farming unless you come from a farming background, it's an [extreme] exercise to start up a new farm and if there was support given to farmers to be able to do that, that's an awesome thing," he says. Soil & Health Association spokesperson Jenny Lux says the party's policy of creating a New Zealand sustainable food certification could finally help the country meet its '100% Pure' aspiration. "However, a national accreditation would only work if it was based on measuring outcomes and met the standards for regenerative organic agriculture already recognised worldwide," Lux says. The association also welcome the policy of capital investment and other support for growers wanting to transition to regenerative organic. "The set-up costs are often a major barrier to changing farming systems," Lux says. Green Party co-leaders Marama Davidson and James Shaw along with environment spokesperson Eugenie Sage being shown around by Logan Kerr and Dominique Schacherer on an organic farm in Leeston on 12 September, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver But the National Party has labelled the policy a "slap in the face" for farmers. Its agriculture spokesperson, David Bennett, says the proposed nitrogen reduction limits are madness and would "kill off dairying" across the country. In a statement, Bennett says now is not the time to be putting the brakes on the export industry. "We are facing the worst economic downturn in 160 years and agriculture will lead our post-Covid recovery," he says. "The Greens' policy is yet another assault on Kiwi farmers after the Labour-led Government hit them with freshwater reforms that, in some cases, are unworkable and will shackle their ability to innovate while piling costs on to a sector that is vitally important to our country." He says National supports having cleaner waterways in New Zealand, but there are smarter ways to achieve this. Meanwhile, Mori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said the Greens' policy was already announced by her party in July. "It's good that the Green Party have picked up our policy for a $300m fund to support farmers, and have joined us in responding to environmental groups by committing to phase out synthetic fertilisers," she says. "We look forward to working with them to get these policies over the line."

Carmel Sepuloni says the support is critical to ensuring that "people continue to develop the skills needed for New Zealand's economic recovery and rebuild." Photo: RNZ / Richard Tindiller Social development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni has announced the party's election policy. In 2009, the National government cut back training incentive allowances (TIA) to sole parents and those on invalids' benefits - restricting them to sub-degree study. Sepuloni said this allowance was an investment in a family's future, and one she herself had used in the past. "Access to support for higher level courses under the TIA was taken away by National, despite the responsible, Minister Paula Bennett herself having benefited from this support. "Labour is putting the ladder of support back in place after National pulled it up behind them," Sepuloni says. In 2018 about 900 people accessed the allowance; if people could get it for degree level study that would boost those numbers initially to just over 6000, rising to 15,000 in later years. People can get up to $112.89 a week, with a total maximum of $4515.60 a year, and it can be used alongside student loans and childcare assistance. It's targeted at sole parents, disabled people and their carers, and provides extra support towards the cost of study. "Research shows those who gain higher level qualifications are more likely to get a job, build a career and earn more," she says. "This support is critical to ensuring that our people continue to develop the skills needed for New Zealand's economic recovery and rebuild." Ana Pahulu, who was present at the announcement in West Auckland, started her study in the University of Auckland in 2004, when her daughter was three-and-a-half years old. She said being on a single parent benefit meant ends were never met and the Training Incentive Allowance helped. Pahulu said the money enabled students like her to take a bus to lectures, and print and photo-copy assignments, and the announcement made her extremely happy as more families will benefit from it. "It translates to very real small things and the things that actually enable you to do your studies." This policy would cost about $431 million over four years, and around $187m in capital over 10 years and will be paid for out of the Covid Response and Recovery Fund. Labour would also increase abatement thresholds so people could earn more in part-time work - up to $160 a week, before their benefit is reduced, about eight hours on the minimum wage. At the moment benefits start reducing for any earnings over $90 a week for someone on Jobseeker support. The thresholds would also increase for Sole Parent Support the Supported Living Payment. "This will enable people to keep more of what they earn and increase the financial incentive to stay in or take up part-time work. "This policy builds on the change we already implemented to lift abatement rates in line with minimum wage increases," Sepuloni said. "We know that part-time work can be an important step toward full-time work, but the current thresholds can make it hard for people to enter the labour market or take on more part-time work. It also means low income families don't get to keep extra income they earn that could help them get by." This change would benefit up to 30,000 New Zealanders, for some people up to $70 a week. Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson say sshe is pleased to see Labour acknowlege some steps that urgently need to progress. "We're very clear that one of the most urgent changes that need to be made is a guaranteed minimum income, which will lift the current benefit rates to a level that actually allows people to live with dignity," Davidson said. "The Greens obviously will go a lot further in our proposals. We're pleased to see Labour come a little bit towards those plans as well." National Party's social development spokesperson Louise Upston said Labour was too focused on welfare, despite there already being job opportunities in industries like horticulture. "People are way better off in work, it might not be the dream job but a job is better than no job. We've got to make sure that we are connecting people to the jobs available and that the focus is on an economy and businesses where jobs are being created." Currently if someone is receiving the Jobseeker Support unemployment benefit and earns more than $90 per week, they will lose 70 cents of their benefit for every $1 they earn. For sole parents who are receiving the Sole Parent Support benefit and disabled people or people with longer term health conditions on the Supported Living Payment, they can currently earn up to $115 before their benefit is reduced by 30 cents for every $1 they earn. They then have a second threshold of $215, and every $1 earned after this is reduced at 70 cents per dollar. The estimated cost is up to $320m over four years; additional costs of year on year increases in line with minimum wage were already committed in Budget 2019. Labour's already announced its plan to expand the Flexi-Wage programme with an additional $300m to increase the average subsidy to $7500 and enable up to 40,000 people to take advantage of the programme. As part of its Covid response, the government boosted main benefits by $25 a week, and doubled the Winter Energy Payment for this year.

Kapa-Kingi, who is a qualified social worker, told RNZ the current system was failing Mori. "The current system, what it does not understand is who Mori are and the way we believe, function and live. "This doesn't work, certainly it doesn't work for Mori - let's step aside and do this." She said the current system was "fundamentally racist and flawed" as it was rooted in Western ways of living. "Every mokopuna gets a pkeh response. You're speaking in pkeh, thinking in pkeh and the models being applied are pkeh. "We're smart people. We're smart Mori-thinking people. We know what's best for us. We do not need anyone non-Mori tell us what we need anymore. It's just our time." The plan would also create a partnership network with Mori organisations as well as hap and iwi, to help children remain connected to their whakapapa. In a statement, the party said through this entity, the allocated funding, and the partnership network, "we will rightfully reclaim our tino rangatiratanga as protected under Article 2 of Te Tiriti in respect of the greatest taonga of all - our mokopuna".

Co-leader James Shaw said as the country recovers from Covid-19 there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform the way food is produced and grown. Shaw said a quantity-over-quality approach to farming has degraded rivers and waterways, harmed animals, and is warming the climate.

Photo: Public Domain, ex NASA She won praise from Mori and Pakeha for recognising the Mori New Year, public holidays are popular with the vast majority of voters and the decision was difficult to oppose without critics looking like spoilsports. It's also something that can definitely be achieved. Ardern can swiftly put a Holidays (Matariki) Amendment Bill through Parliament with Mori filling the public galleries. It should have locked in a few votes. News outlet Stuff, which has been campaigning for a Matariki holiday, headlined its report "Matariki move a masterstroke". National leader Judith Collins said some of her team thought it was a great idea but she was concerned about its impact on businesses - another public holiday employers would have to pay for. Stuff picked up on that aspect in its report, recalling that Helen Clark's Labour government increased annual leave from three to four weeks in the early 2000s. There were dire warnings at the time about the effect that would have but the sky didn't fall and now it's accepted as simply a cost of doing business. Labour's other big announcement wasn't good news, and Grant Robertson ignored the historic belief that announcing a tax hike before an election is a sure way to lose votes. He decided to do it in the first week of the campaign and get it out the way. It was, however, relatively benign and there can't be many Labour voters among those who earn more than $180,000 a year. They are the ones who will have to pay 39 cents in the dollar on income above that level. The current top rate is 33 cents which cuts in at $70,000. Robertson said it would affect only two percent of earners and bring in $550 million a year. The other 98 percent probably think they can afford it. "Our plan strikes a balance as we recover from Covid-19," he said. "It will avoid the cuts to services being suggested by the National Party and also help keep the lid on debt as we support the economic recovery from a 1-in-100 year shock." It means someone earning $200,000 a year would pay an extra $23 a week. That's a cup of coffee a day, said Winston Peters, who thinks it won't raise nearly enough revenue. National said it was just the beginning. "Labour will eventually widen the net and come after middle income earners," finance spokesman Paul Goldsmith told Morning Report. "We don't need more taxes at a time like this nobody got themselves out of a recession by increasing taxes." Tax expert Geof Nightingale, a member of the government's Tax Working Group, said higher earners would be able to put their money in companies or trusts to avoid taxes. Collins had a busy week, kicking off with a $50m policy to deal with the methamphetamine scourge - four years after former prime minister John Key announced his own "war on P". "We can either decide that we're going to lose the war or we're going to decide to take it seriously," Collins said. "A National government will tackle this problem from all angles, addressing both demand and supply." The new war plan also focuses on treatment and rehabilitation as well as cracking down on drug smugglers. Collins also unveiled a plan to create a National Infrastructure Bank. It would consolidate several existing agencies and provide finance and advice to local government on infrastructure projects. How it would do that takes some explaining, and finance spokesman Paul Goldsmith had a go: "Our infrastructure bank will provide clear lines of accountability to not only ensure value for money but also deliver tangible assets that underpin future development in the form of better resourced schools, health services, water provision and housing." The main parties released a raft of relatively minor policies. Among them, Labour promised to extend the Small Business Cashflow Loan scheme and National said it would fund a Hawke's Bay Hospital upgrade. The minor parties were there too, and Act announced a substantial policy. It would take mental health funding away from the Ministry of Health and DHBs and instead channel it to patients and providers through a Mental Health and Addiction Commission. Deputy leader and health spokesperson Brooke van Velden said the current system was a disorderly mix of funding arrangements with providers struggling to deliver a co-ordinated response. "We need a new approach to addiction and mental health in this country, it's clear the status quo isn't working," she said. Winston Peters took NZ First's campaign to Southland, where he met workers at Tiwai Point aluminium smelter. Owner Rio Tinto intends closing it in August next year, putting more than 2000 jobs at risk and threatening many more in the local economy. Peters told them there was no reason why Tiwai Point couldn't continue operating for another two decades, and his plan could be negotiated by Rio Tinto, the power companies and Transpower. To make it happen Southland voters would have to support his party and give him the leverage he needed to negotiate on their behalf. Peters said keeping Tiwai Point open was a bottom line for his party, meaning he would insist on it being part of any coalition agreement. It wasn't all serious politicking during the first week. Peters is learning a new way of campaigning because of social distancing restrictions. He's at his best in front of packed audiences at public meetings, the noisier the better. That isn't happening and he's been on walkabouts instead. Politik's Richard Harman was with him in Dunedin and wrote this account: "A first attempt at a walk around the Octagon produced one encounter with three young men enjoying the spring sun and having a beer and then a group of schoolgirls, half of whom, unfortunately, were wearing blindfolds because they were trying to experience what it would be like to be disabled." Wellington Central candidates at Victoria University's Students Association election debate were given 'Yes' and 'No' cards and asked whether they had smoked cannabis. All seven held up their 'Yes' cards, Stuff reported. For the record they were Andrew Little (Justice Minister, standing in for Grant Robertson), James Shaw (Green Party co-leader), Nicola Willis (National MP), Brooke van Velden (ACT deputy leader), Jesse Richardson (independent), Abe Gray (TOP) and Takuta Ferris (Mori Party). The traditionally raucous Aro Valley candidates meeting was limited to 50 people because of social distancing but there was no shortage of hecklers and water pistols. *Peter Wilson is a life member of Parliament's press gallery, 22 years as NZPA's political editor and seven as parliamentary bureau chief for NZ Newswire.

Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi. Photo: 2020 Getty Images Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi said the change will allow businesses to access critical staff whose skills are not readily obtainable here. "As New Zealand continues on the path to recovery from Covid-19, it is important that we strike the right balance between protecting New Zealand from Covid-19 and ensuring businesses have the critical workers they need to help in our recovery," Faafoi said in a release. "Currently, an individual must have unique experience and technical or specialist skills that are 'not obtainable' in New Zealand. This criterion will change to technical or specialist skills that are not 'readily obtainable' in New Zealand. "That wording change reflects that, in some fields, there is a very limited pool of experts and significant training would have to be undertaken before the skills were obtainable in New Zealand." The government will remove the requirement for "the skills, qualifications or work experience to have been gained overseas." "Removing that requirement will allow entry, in some limited cases, where, for example, a worker has skills which are obtainable in New Zealand but they have unique experience gained overseas which would bring unique expertise to New Zealand businesses," Faafoi said. "These changes are in response to concerns various sectors have been raising with us and aim to help provide clarity for businesses requesting a border exception for critical workers. He said the bar for being granted an exemption remains high to limit the spread of Covid-19 and to managed capacity constraints in managed isolation facilities. "There will still be a number of workers across a range of sectors and businesses who do not meet the criteria to be granted an exception under this 'other critical worker' category. "That is because any changes must still align with New Zealand's tight Covid-19 border controls to limit the spread of the virus. We also need to continue coordinating the numbers of people coming across the border with amount of capacity available in managed isolation and quarantine facilities to cope." Faafoi said the changes to the "other critical worker" border exception category instructions will take effect immediately. It follows a week of announcements allowing temporary workers, some partners and newly-minted residents stranded overseas to come to New Zealand. He said the government will prioritise making sure New Zealanders who have lost jobs have the opportunity to move into new work. Employers are welcoming the easing of border restrictions. Alan McDonald of the Employers and Manufacturers Association said the government had recognised that there was a shallow domestic talent pool in some sectors. He said executives, engineers and IT staff would be among those who could now qualify. McDonald said some businesses may say it did not go far enough, although the government was constrained by capacity in border management facilities.

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018763484/election-2020-tourism-debate-kelvin-davis-and-todd-mcclay|2020-09-10|Last year tourism was New Zealand's number one export, but Covid-19 has brought it to its knees, after our borders essentially slammed shut back in March. The sector directly employs about 230,000 people, but with no signs of the country opening up to international visitors anytime soon, what is the future for an industry that has until recently made up almost a quarter of our exports? Labour's Kelvin Davis and National's Todd McClay join Lisa Owen to debate tourism policies. Tourism in NZ: Survival mode or recovery? Todd McClay: "I think it's a combination of both, there aretourism businesses that are in survival mode, and some of them who are not sure how they're going to survive. At the same time, there are real opportunities around domestic tourism, but the problem I think we have in the very short term is aroundcompetence and certainty. "So if we look at Taup and Rotorua as an example, two tourist destinations, they started to do much better after the initial lockdown was lifted and largely it was visitors from Auckland for weekends and for longer. But when we had the systematic failure at the border and this virus established itself in Auckland again and Auckland went into level 3 the door was shut." Kelvin Davis: "I tend to agree with Todd there are some businesses that are doing it really tough, but also there are glimmers of hope on the horizon. We didn't expect domestic tourism to be quite as responsive as it was, so that was really positive." Govt's $400m tourism recovery package and strategic tourism assets Davis: "What we're trying to do with the tourism recovery fund is to try and spread it as wide as we could to make sure we got the biggest impact. So the initial part was $17 million went to the tourism transitions fund to help businesses to either pivot to the domestic market or hibernate or to explore other options. Davis said operations like Wellington Zoo and Zorb Rotorua met criteria to receive funding as strategic tourism assets. "They would attract visitors in their own right, if they didn't exist then there may be significant loss of spillover effects into other businesses. "The criteria and all the applications went through a very rigorous business, they were assessed, there were peer-reviewed, they were moderated by MBIE MBIE consulted with a number of other agencies such as Mori Tourism." McClay: "I don't know that we would have funded the same businesses, but we would have had a very open and transparent system that treated everybody equally and fairly. "Question of why Wellington Zoo got funding and Auckland Zoo didn't is a very good one, maybe one of them had an extra elephant. Actually both of them should have been assessed the same and had the same opportunity. "The problem we've got is about $300 million was spent very, very quickly. Every single dollar of that has to be borrowed and paid back sometime in the future. And there's about 140 businesses around New Zealand that have been helped. Take the example of AJ Hackett, good on him he applied, but he was given $10 million to save 20 jobs. There'll be businesses down the road in Queensland with the same if not more need, and actually didn't get that funding and don't get to save those jobs." Davis: "That raises the question, Todd is saying what about the tens of thousands of other businesses, so I assume that he's saying that National would have funded those tens of thousands of other businesses, and then what's the cost to that? "We had to make decisions, we had to draw lines in the sand somewhere and that's exactly what we did. The process was open, it is transparent, and of course there are going to be some people who didn't receive funding We've always said from the outset that we couldn't save every business in every job but we had to make decisions. "He said in his comments just then that this money was spent quickly. Well, he's spent the last five months criticising me saying that we're not doing things fast enough so he can't have it both ways." National's tourism policies? McClay: "We will be announcing a full round of tourism policies in the coming weeks so [the Tourism Accelerator Fund] that's only one component of it, but ultimately it's very similar to the tourism growth partnership we had under the last government where the tourism sector was able to look at innovation, ways to drive tourism, to change their businesses. It was fully assessed and decisions were made independently of the government. I would have a view that we would want an independent group of people making these decisions not the Cabinet." Cabinet would do final sign-off, he said. Davis: "If we talk about the National Party's policy it actually is $100 million over four years, $25 million in the first year. Now, we allocated $400 million in the last six months. $25 million that they're offering is one-sixteenth of what we've done... I think it's an insult really to the tourism industry to say 'here's $25 million'." McClay:"It's the first part of policy and we'll be announcing more I'm not going to announce it today, but actually what we're doing is looking both in the short term is how we get businesses through the next period." Opening borders? McClay: "I do think we need a responsible debate around what an open border might look like. If we have a consideration of Singapore as an example, they've come to a position where they want to welcome New Zealand visitors there. I don't believe the border of New Zealand can be opened safely today, but what is really important for the tourism sector is the start of that conversation about what it might look like and when it might happen. "A very low level of risk would be important, we do need to consider health. We need to ensure that the Border Agency has control of the border and that we have track and trace and the ability to get on top of any incursion very quickly. "Earlier this year, there was ongoing discussion about the trans-Tasman border and the Cook Islands, the government had announced opening up travel to the Cook Islands, so that demonstrates there are opportunities or ways that this can happen." Davis: "You asked Todd what his policies were and he just said he wants to have a big conversation. Our plan is actually being implemented. What he described is what we're actually doing in terms of the contact tracing, we had a resurgence plan, unfortunately we had to implement it. "When Covid-19 initially hit, people were asking me to stand up and speculate about when the trans-Tasman bubble would be opened, and I didn't, I wouldn't speculate because businesses would go out and they would make business decisions about hiring staff and training staff. "Thank goodness that we didn't speak late on timeframes, because to be honest we were hoping it would be around about now that the trans-Tasman bubble would have been opened. And if we'd got to a situation where we are now, after me speculating about this timeframe, businesses would have said we'd given mixed and confusing messages. "There are things that can be done in the meantime, so for example Tourism New Zealand, they've been charged with keeping the brand New Zealand alive in the hearts and minds of our international markets." Matariki public holiday? McClay: "I do think Matariki is a good idea, I support it, but I've got to tell you when they announced it inRotorua on Monday and billed it as a solution to the challenges that the tourism industry is facing at the moment, it actually is not going to help at all, it's two years away. Kelvin, if another holiday is going to fix tourism let's have 10 this year, please. "I do think we should take an existing holiday and move it over rather than another one." Loosening physical distancing rules on planes? Davis: "We've had this conversation in Cabinet We understand the concerns, but ultimately we listen to the latest advice, the latest health advice, and make decisions based on that." McClay: "If the masks work and declared to be safe, yes we should do it. As tourism minister, I would be advocating for it. It would be for [Ministry of] Health to say whether or not it's possible."

No, not National's Infrastructure Bank. Definitely not a new public holiday. Though we'll come to those. It was Labour's tax policy. How brave would it be? Would Labour dare to promise transformation or would it play it safer? We got the answer yesterday - a new top tax rate of 39 percent for those earning over $180,000. A promise to try a bit harder on taxing multi-nationals. And that was it. As Guyon Espiner says in today's Caucus podcast, if 'tax is love' then this was a peck on the cheek. An elbow bump at best. Subscribe free to Caucus onApple Podcasts,Spotify,iHeartGoogle PodcastsorRadioPublic. Labour Party finance spokesperson Grant Robertson in Tauranga on 8 September, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Is this the tax policy Jacinda Ardern and Grant Robertson dreamed of unveiling through their long years in Opposition? By no means. They believe in a Capital Gains Tax. They would certainly tax harder if they could. But Robertson's argument is that what has largely been described as a timid approach to tax policy is the "right thing to do right now". And have no doubt, it is timid. In 2014 David Cunliffe's policy was 36 percent on income over $150,000 and in 2011 Phil Goff's 'tax switch' involved an interest free zone and 39 cents over $150,000. Back when Labour last introduced a new top tax rate - under Helen Clark in 1999 - it was 39 cents on incomes over $60,000 (which is around $90,000 in today's money). Even with the move to a 39 percent top tax rate New Zealand will still have the 12th lowest top tax rate of the 36 countries in the OECD; so staying in the bottom third. Australia's is 47 percent, Canada's 53.5 and Britain's 45. And given it cuts in only at $180,000 - as Robertson endlessly repeats, it only taxes the top two percent of earners - it's at the conservative end of the developed world. In sum: timid. The Caucus crew though acknowledgeit does the job politically, taking tax off the table at the election this year. If the Left are frustrated, the Right are disarmed. Perhaps even more importantly, Robertson's comments that this is the right move for our times suggest that Labour's read is that the electorate is more volatile and jumpy than many believe.Scott Campbell agrees, sayingthat if they'd gone much further it would have dramatically lengthened the odds on a Labour victory, maybe even putting it at risk. Amidst a global pandemic, voters are anxious and easily frightened. Tax is a policy that Labour knows from bitter experience is one that can change the way people vote. Hence the caution. Matariki star cluster from southern hemisphere Photo: NASA At the populist end of the policy debate though, Labour has shamelessly offered voters an extra day's holiday. Lisa Owens describes it as a reflection of our fragility; a reward for our troubled times. The biggest criticism, as Campbell points out, has come from within Moridom. There's an element of 'beads and blankets' about it, as it signals a commitment to Mori culture while drawing a veil over Labour's failure to move the dial on material hardship and poverty, arguably the biggest and toughest issue facing Mori. On the other hand, as Espiner points out, no party has played the race card on the suggestion of a Matariki holiday. Such a policy at the 2005 election would have been used to suggest 'race-based' bias. It's remarkable how much the public mood as changed. That also seems to be reflected in some of the meaty policy National has been rolling out this week. A "baby bonus" scheme, a meth policy that focuses on health not law and order ("we can't arrest our way out of this," said Judith Collins on Morning Report), and an Infrastructure Bank for plenty of government borrowing. This isn't the Crusher Collins some predicted would shake up National. It's a kinder Collins we're seeing instead. National Party leader Judith Collins announcing the party's Hawke's Bay Hospital election promise on 8 September, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone The Infrastructure Bank is an interesting solution to New Zealand's infrastructure deficit that deserves more coverage than it's had and, as Espiner points out, has the benefit of bringing some fiscal discipline to government slush funds such as the Provincial Growth Fund, without walking away from the spending altogether. Finally in this week's podcast, we debate the debates. TVNZ has taken the embarrassing step of changing the criteria around its 'multi-party' debate, adding the Mori Party and Advance NZ, but still leaving the Opportunities Party and New Conservatives out in the cold. The criteria were a seat in parliament or three percent in a recent poll,drawn up in 2011 when Espiner and I were working at TVNZ. We were both in the meeting where they were settled, as we wrestled with fair treatment of the likes of the Maori Party andUnited Future. There is no simple or perfect line to draw; you are balancing competing rights and any media organisation should be independent to decide the entry criteria for itself. Photo: RNZ However, times have changed, the major parties are more dominant and several minor parties are well below that three percent threshold. Those criteria now skewin favour of incumbents and shuts out fresh voices and ideas. Caucus has a couple of suggestions, such as a Contenders' Debate for the smaller parties or hosting debates on YouTube, where you can run beyond a commercial hour or hour and a half, meaning more party leaders don't come at the cost of minutes per leader.

We're calling them "The Outliers" - the small parties also striving for a place in Parliament - an array of colourful characters with starkly different, sometimes controversial, policy manifestos. For some, like the Mori Party, it's a tough path back to regain seats they'd held for several years, and for others their first foray into the world of politics. RNZ political reporter Katie Scotcher hit the road to meet The Outliers and hear about their plans to woo the voting public. Geoff Simmons - a keen cyclist, economist and improv actor - pitches himself as a leader who would ask the tough questions. Geoff Simmons. Photo: RNZ "I've spent my career researching the solutions to New Zealand's biggest problems, and frankly, I've just got hugely frustrated because I've seen career politicians throw those solutions in the too hard basket." The party won just 2.4 percent of the vote at the last election, under the leadership of its founder Gareth Morgan. The provocative leader, known for his outbursts on social media and not his policies, was replaced by Simmons in 2018. Simmons is willing to work with almost any party to get into Parliament. Although he admits some parties are "less interested in the evidence and more dogmatic than others". TOP is campaigning on "evidence-based" policies - it wants to "stabilise" the cost of housing by building medium density housing near public transport in cities and managing immigration. It also wants to introduce a weekly universal basic income of $250 per week for everyone and prioritise a climate-friendly Covid-19 response. "We're looking beyond the three year cycle of getting re-elected and we want to talk about the really big issues that are affecting the country long-term, because most career politicians don't worry about those sorts of things - they just worry about getting re-elected." The Mori Party is fighting to return to Parliament, after a crushing defeat at the last election. John Tamihere, co-leader of the Mori Party. Photo: RNZ Co-leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and John Tamihere are promising to uphold the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi and for 25 percent of all government contracts to support Mori. Ngarewa-Packer explained their main priorities. "Ensuring that we have healthy families who can self-determine and live their best lives and in order to also do that, it's about preserving whakapapa, and ensuring that we have a safe and healthy environment to live with and on and to leave for future generations," she says. Tamihere has previously served as a Labour minister, but at number seven on his party's list, it's highly unlikely he'll return to Parliament without winning the Tamaki Makaurau seat. The Mori Party has always campaigned on winning electorate support, Tamihere says. "We want the mandate off the street. If you get the mandate from the hood, you got some big say ... because the people have spoken," he said. Tamihere is confident he has the support he needs, saying he wouldn't throw his hat in the ring if he wasn't. Politics and campaigning is all new for Vision New Zealand's Hannah Tamaki, who's better known for leading Destiny Church with her husband Brian. Hannah Tamaki. Photo: RNZ "I didn't know what I was walking into, what I was stepping into and I still don't know everything, but what I do know is that people matter and the choices they make matter, but their voice is important and I think that sometimes those voices are not being heard." Tamaki launched the party last year, to be a "voice for the silent majority" and to get strong family values into Parliament. When asked who exactly the "silent majority" is, Tamaki says it is people who haven't voted before. Vision New Zealand doesn't have many policies, but would roll-out Destiny Church's controversial Man-Up and Legacy prison programmes if elected. It is also promising to ban all immigration and refugees for two years, although it's a policy Tamaki backtracked on. "Not just a total ban for refugees, because a refugee status is a little bit different ... there would have to be the criteria and of course ... I've got a heart," she says. And despite her ties to Destiny Church, she is adamant Vision New Zealand is not a Christian party. "People don't have to go to church to be members of Vision New Zealand, they don't have to go to church to vote for Vision New Zealand." Leighton Baker and the New Conservatives are promising to scrap all of the changes made to firearms legislation, as well as repeal the Emission Trading Scheme and Zero Carbon Bill if elected. Leighton Baker. Photo: RNZ It also wants to reduce the number of sitting MPs and make binding referenda more common. "Democracy allows us to debate and discuss and argue a wee bit, and then hopefully come to a place where we can all agree and if we don't agree it's a majority thing," Baker says. "But without democracy I think we're enslaved by someone else's opinion, which we don't really want." Like Vision New Zealand, the New Conservatives also want an immigration crack down. "Net zero immigration until our housing is sorted out. You can't invite someone round to your house if you haven't got enough beds for them." The ban wouldn't be indefinite, he says. "We'd like it to be short term. The shorter the better." Baker, who has been party leader since 2017, describes himself as a reasonable and practical leader, "I am who I am, I guess". New Zealand Public Party leader Billy Te Kahika has a large following and it's growing. Billy Te Kahika. Photo: RNZ "Something has happened with this movement that's never happened before quite like this in the New Zealand political landscape," Te Kahika says. But just days into campaign, he has garnered some unwanted attention - that of the Electoral Commission. It's looking at his party's finances and how it handles donations, after a complaint to the Serious Fraud Office. He's teamed up with former National MP Jami Lee Ross - who fell out spectacularly with his party and is now facing serious fraud charges in the High Court. His prospects of keeping the staunchly National seat of Botany don't look good but his incumbency provides a gossamer thin opportunity for the alliance to gain a place in Parliament - under the rules one seat is enough. Ross' new political partner, Te Kahika - a Northland blues musician - has posted hours of conspiracy-theory fuelled videos online, in which he claims Covid-19 is a "plandemic" and Bill Gates is influencing government decision making. When RNZ asked what Te Kahika thought of people who call him a conspiracy theorist, he said they were "uneducated".

Megan Woods says NZ can be one of the few countries with 100 percent renewable electricity. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone In a statement, Labour leader Jacinda Ardern said the policy will ensure New Zealand has sustainable and affordable energy while protecting jobs. "The Covid-19 economic recovery represents a once in a generation opportunity to reshape New Zealand's energy system to be more renewable faster, affordable and secure. "Investment in renewable energy is also jobs rich. Our plan will creating new jobs and develop the high skill workforce our future economy needs to thrive. "Labour's Clean Energy Plan is a critical element of Labour's wider COVID-19 recovery plan that will both prepare New Zealand for the future while boosting jobs and the economy now," Ardern said. Energy spokesperson Megan Woods said New Zealand has the opportunity to be one of the few nations in the world with 100 percent renewable electricity. "New Zealand produces 84 percent of its electricity from renewable sources now, but we can do better. We will stop activities that increase our emissions by, for example, banning new thermal baseload generation; and promote clean energy development," Woods said. "We are committed to taking the next steps to get to 100 percent renewable with support for projects like pumped hydro at Lake Onslow, removing the barriers to development of new renewable electricity projects, advancing green hydrogen and other green technologies and supporting businesses to decarbonise. "Our plan for clean energy and lower carbon emissions will help us seize the economic opportunities of being the clean, green country that New Zealanders see ourselves as being and that we can market ourselves as. The Labour Party would also support the roll-out of a nationwide hydrogen refuelling network. "A great example of work we can do to become a world leader is the development of a green hydrogen industry," Woods said. "We can produce some of the cleanest green hydrogen in the world, and potentially receive a premium for it in international markets. "We are already working with other countries including Japan and have invested in a nationwide fuelling network and will invest $10 million in a roadmap and further opportunities," she said. National Party leader Judith Collins said the plan would hammer Kiwis' back pockets. The policy would increase the cost of electricity by as much as 40 percent, despite Labour promising no new taxes, Collins claimed. "This is a policy that will cost thousands of jobs and put even more people on to the unemployment benefit." National wanted more renewable electricity, but Labour's plan would only increase electricity prices and reduce reliability, Collins said.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425689/no-need-for-more-tax-at-a-time-like-this-national-s-paul-goldsmith|2020-09-10|The National Party says Labour's promise to raise income tax only for the highest income earners will hurt wealth creators, while an expert from the government's working group says it will do nothing to alleviate inequality. National finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith and Labour finance spokesman Grant Robertson Photo: RNZ Labour released its tax policy yesterday, and says it will raise the rate to 39 cents for each dollar earned over $180,000. Apart from that, the party promises no other income tax increases. The National Party, however, insists "Labour will eventually widen the net and come after middle-income earners". Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith told Morning Report we don't need more taxes "at a time like this". "Higher income earners pay a lot more right now, it's a progressive scale and that's appropiate." 'Nobody's got themselves out of a recession by increasing taxes." He said we should have the lowest taxes possible to encourage investment and growth. "The biggest challenge we have as a country is that we're loosing jobs on a massive scale. So how do you get the new jobs - you get new jobs by people investing and growing their business and taking on extra people. "Ultimately, if you're putting up taxes for wealth creators then you make that more difficult." Goldsmith said National would hold taxes where they are but adjust thresholds for inflation. 'It's not a tax cut like National would usually be looking for, because we do recognise that there are fiscal challenges, it's about a sense of direction and where we're trying to get this country." He said people should be worried about the Green Party and their "much more enthusiastic" approach to tax. 'It's an open question about what would happen if there was coalition agreement between Labour and Greens after the election." Asked whether, by the same logic, an ACT coalition with National could mean more severe cuts, Goldsmith said National had a clear answer that they would not adopt ACT's policy. And put to him that that's what Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson has assured also, Goldsmith said Labour can't control it's spending. Goldsmith accused Robertson of spreading misinformation that National would be making major cuts to public spending in their bid to reduce the deficit. He said National has no interest in running an austerity regime and knows now is not the time to be cutting government spending. Robertson said the policy reflected the need for certainty during the Covid-19 pandemic and that's why 98 percent of people will see no change. "We think it's the right tax policy for this time as we navigate our way through these incredibly uncertain times." Asked why the tax policy doesn't reflect promises made in 2015 and 2016 to address income inequality, he said that in those times they weren't dealing with a 1-in-100 year economic shock. "This is the right policy for the time we're in at this moment, to give New Zealanders that level of certainty and stability, and make sure we can focus on recovery and rebuild from Covid-19." Robertson said revenue policy isn't the only way to address inequality and stands by the government's record in other areas to address the issue. Geof Nightingale, a tax specialist at PwC and member of the government's Tax Working Group last year, told Morning Report higher earners will be able to put their money in companies or trusts to avoid taxes. He said it's a relatively low rate for the OECD but other countries have lower taxes in middle income earners and much higher brackets that kick in for large salaries. Nightingale said the new tax will do nothing to alleviate wealth inequality in New Zealand. "All this does is exacerbate the distortion that the working group identified which was that we tax income from personal services relatively hard and there's a big class of economic income like capital gains which, to a large extent, goes untaxed. "The evidence is that quantative easing is likely to seed asset prices so that's only going to increase that distortion." Independent economist Cameron Bagrie described Labour's new tax policy as a "marginal tweak" but the first step in a direction towards higher taxes over the next decade. Bagrie told Nine to Noon that the country faced three significant debt burdens including increased pressure on core spending, the cost of Covid and the looming huge costs associated with an ageing population. "You roll those three challenges together and we've got some pretty hard choices we're going to need to be making over the next 10, 20 even 30 years." The government has already set aside $50 billion in new borrowing specifically for Covid recovery. Government debt was set to peak at 53 percent of GDP by 2023. Bagrie said that Covid was worsening the country's debt burden, but the cost of Superannuation would hamper the sustainability of the country's long-term financial position. He said about 800,000 people were on New Zealand Superannuation which was getting close to being 50 percent of total welfare assistance spending. "And the number is going to keep going up." Bagrie said the outlook for tax revenue in the near-term was a bit better than the government flagged in the Budget, because the hit in the June quarter was less than Treasury anticipated. He said projected debt levels were still "pretty good" compared with international peers, which he expected the government would highlight. Low interest rates meant less constraint on borrowing costs. "The red flags are not waving there but if I look at the flip-side, New Zealand might have better, or lower level of public debt but we've got awful lot higher levels of private sector debt." Bagrie was also concerned that not enough was being put in the emergency kitty to cope with the economic shock of natural disasters which occurred about "every 10 years". He said tax increases were inevitable if the country hoped to get debt levels down to about 40 percent of GDP. But the higher the taxes, the less incentive there was to work and try to get ahead. "Lower taxes keep money in people's pockets, and encourages people to get out there and work a little bit more because you're going to keep more of your hard-earned dollars." Bagrie said a successful formula struck the right balance, which was likely to lead the debate on tax rates.

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018763318/election-2020-health-debate-chris-hipkins-and-shane-reti|2020-09-09|Ahead of the 2020 General Election, National's health spokesperson Dr Shane Reti and Labour's health spokesperson Chris Hipkins debate the main parties' health policies. On Wednesday it was announced that people connected to the Mt Roskill Evangelical Church at the centre of the latest Covid-19 cluster had breached Auckland's level 3 rules. Health Minster Chris Hipkins has asked the police to step in. "Police are going to be helping the Auckland Regional Public Health Service with their contact tracing process, making sure that the right people are being identified, making sure that the right people are being tested, so that we can get on top of this new, small group, as quickly as we possibly can," Hipkins said. Hipkins: "What the investigation will show, eventually, is whether or not this was a deliberate act, whether or not people deliberately didn't disclose who they've been in contact with, or whether it was simply an omission. "It looks like the people who operate at the funeral because all of the things right It would appear actually that most of the positive cases here may have been associated with other events around the funeral, so people visiting each other at home for example. Those are all of the things that the investigation looks at at the moment." Shane Reti: "I think in this situation I'm interested in the prosecution being brought forward, I think if you want a good outcome in this situation, it's not clear to me that prosecuting people is the way to get a good outcome. If you want people to reveal where they've been, if you want to do effective contact tracing, I would have thought doing contact tracing in a culturally competent sort of way, get people on board, have them explain where they've been, that sort of thing, that may be more effective than actually bringing forward prosecution "There may be a place for that, but I'm not sure we should jump into that right now." Reti: "I think there could have been a place for that And people, when I've raised the question of whether the Pokeno border, for example, could have been moved further north maybe to the other side of Waiuku, say where New Zealand Steel is, they raised the question of: 'What about Melbourne? Postcode lottery didn't work from Melbourne'. My response to that would be, well, Melbourne was actually two weeks late doing their lockdown and they didn't carve out the older people like we have. "I think there is a place for postcode lockdown. Secondly, if we consider when we had fruit fly, we locked down a suburb, this is not new to Aucklanders. Now it's a different sort of lockdown, not as constrained as we're doing here now, but  it's not foreign to us." Hipkins: "[Postcode lockdowns] would put us in the same position as Melbourne where they ended up with an ongoing level 4-style lockdown. If you look at where the most recent cluster has spread across Auckland, it is right across Auckland  and if we had just drawn a line on a map and said: 'We're going to take a pick and think it's isolated to this area,' we'd almost certainly be dealing with a much, much larger than we are at the moment." Reti: Vaccine is a "horizon of hope, because it's a long way away, it's probably going to be maybe 12-18 months, if not longer, so I'm reluctant to consider that an effective tool just here and now in our toolbox. "Our Border Protection Agency proposal is that we have exit testing or departure testing from your point of departure, before you come in. "I wouldn't [go for a potentially shorter stay in quarantine] because I've seen the Shaun Hendy modelling and what that suggests is that 14 days with a day three and day 12 test is probably the sweet spot." Hipkins: "I wouldn't go that far at this point. There are likely to be future pandemics, and we need to start thinking about planning for those." Reti: "I wouldn't disagree with that. They come infrequently. I think we need to have the people response, ready to move quickly." Hipkins: "It would depend how many vaccines we were able to get, but obviously we'd be looking at those more susceptible to Covid-19, so looking at who's at greater risk if they do get it. We'd obviously be looking at our border workers and those who work in the health system." Reti: "This would be a risk stratified approach and it would be those who are having the most contact with those who are likely to be carrying, what is the nature of that contact, how long is that contact  That's a good sort of framework to make decisions on. "What I haven't heard here is our older people, they can't be too far away from the vaccine because we know they're extremely vulnerable." Reti: "We'd be bringing frontline services much closer to the community  social cohesion, that's what's going to be important for our recovery. And to do that we're going to need to take mental health services close to the community, designed by the community, it may be specialists, especially, for example, in general practice rooms. We're going to need to utilise tools like elearning, we're going to have to bring in that large cultural capital component to design these sort of mental health programmes." Hipkins: "What Shane's described is exactly what the government's doing, so we are putting more frontline mental health services into primary practice. We are working closely with communities to make sure that investment is going to the right places, delivering mental health support in ways that meet the needs of different communities, because it's not a one size fits all model here, different communities need different things. "A big part of the $1.9 billion investment that the government made in mental health in Budget 2019 is designed to build up the capability and the capacity to train more people to get them into those frontline roles where they can provide the extra support. "You're seeing as a result of Covid-19 the government putting extra investment into our schools, into those primary, intermediate years where young people can start to develop mental health problems and making sure that they're getting access to the sort of support they need." Reti: "There was a big number put into Budget 2019, $1.9. billion. But the argument is also made that only $125 million of that is being spent Certainly what's being put to me is that maybe only 4 percent of general practices are getting any frontline services as a consequence of that Budget. So it's fine to apportion the funding, but is it actually being deployed?" Hipkins: "In both of the referendum questions I've indicated that I'm not going to publicly disclose how I'm going to vote. "Ultimately this is New Zealanders' decision and I'm not going to be campaigning for or against either of those questions." Reti: "My clinical observation, over many years of practice, is that legalising cannabis is not a good safe and healthy thing to do. That's my personal and professional opinion as well. "We're going right from nothing, all the way to legalising. Now a large number of countries have stopped at decriminalisation and various other steps on the way to legal and recreational cannabis. It seems a big jump to go all the way there. "But if the people of New Zealand decide that this is where they'd like to progress, we will introduce the legislation in our hands and we will take it to select committee." Hipkins: "I'm not going to be announcing that to you today. It will be in the next few weeks and we will set out our manifesto that will set a clear direction of travel, but the direction of travel will be broadly consistent with what's on the report. "There would certainly be fewer [District Health Boards]. We haven't landed on an exact number years or what the boundaries of that might be." Reti: "I do think that if that is the direction of travel, which we're hearing [reduction of DHBs], that needs to be put on the campaign trail. Which DHBs are going, which DHBs are standing? Tell us what it is, if you're late in the piece, show us what your early thinking is anyway. But either way, this is a very important campaign item, and I think the minister should come forward. "We've already said that we won't be changing the bricks and mortar DHBs we'll be maintaining them as they are, but there is some aggregation for example around regional planning, where some of the strategy and planning functions might well serve a region where they could come together. So some of the functions might aggregate, but we won't be taking away from any particular areas DHBs as proposed in the Simpson report, and I think [Labour] should put that on the campaign trail." Hipkins: "We will have some alternative targets, I think National's targets were too narrow and too prone to be gamed. But we will have some targets." Reti: "Absolutely [we'll] have those targets. It's interesting to hear the minister, for three years we've heard: 'No we don't believe in targets,' and suddenly we're hearing a few weeks before an election, so maybe they've seen the benefit and focus that targets bring." Reti: "I do." Hipkins: "Yes, I do."

Lisa Owen asked Finance Minister and Labour's finance spokesperson Grant Robertson: "You've made some guarantees around this, you say that there's going to be no other taxes and no other increases in income tax right? Surely that's dependent on your coalition partners & any negotiations, or are you saying this as an absolute bottom line, no matter who you might be in government with? Grant Robertson: "This is Labour's tax policy & what we're saying is this is what we will be implementing in this term of government if we get the opportunity to be elected." Owen: That was said about other Labour policies, but they were lost in the MMP environment of coalition government."So are you saying this is absolutely a bottom line for tax, or for example, you go in with the Greens and they want more and they dig their toes in, is this negotiable?" Robertson: "This is the tax policy that we will be implementing as a Labour government."Owen: "It's one thing to promise people that this is Labour's policy, and it's another to say that regardless of what any partners and government want, you are going to stick with that, so I'll just ask it again to be absolutely sure. Is this your bottom line in terms of income tax policy if you need to form a coalition, or a confidence & supply agreement? Robertson: "A Labour government will be implementing the policy that we announced today, Lisa. It's not a matter of bottom lines for us from this perspective. And I haven't actually heard the Green Party use that phrasing, either. From our perspective this is what we will implement, just what we announced today."

Watch the National Party leader explain the policy here: The Crown Financial Institution, named the National Infrastructure Bank, would consolidate existing agencies including Crown Infrastructure Partners, Green Investment, Provincial Growth Fund loans and residual holdings at Crown Irrigation Investments Limited. Collins says the bank would offer institutional investors such as the Accident Compensation Corporation and NZ Super Fund an avenue to take on investment risk in New Zealand infrastructure assets. "A key part of National's plan to deal with the current economic and jobs crisis is to deliver world-class infrastructure that grows our economy and gets Kiwis back to work. "To do that we have to invest, and every dollar borrowed must be spent wisely on projects that improve our economy and build productivity," Collins said. National's finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said major infrastructure projects require a co-ordinated, disciplined approach to planning and financing. "We recognise the need for effective management of the vast sums of debt being borrowed to make sure it is carefully managed and well deployed. "Our infrastructure bank will provide clear lines of accountability to not only ensure value-for-money, but also deliver tangible assets that underpin future development in the form of better resourced schools, health services, roads, water provisions and housing," Goldsmith said. Funding for the bank would come from baseline funding from the various agencies, but full costings are yet to be completed.

Mori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. Photo: Supplied The party, which was ousted from Parliament at the last election, has today announced its income policy. It wants to legislate for an annual income increase to keep up with cost of living increases. It also wants to guarantee pay equity for Mori nurses and teachers. Mori Party co-leader and Te Tai Hauuru candidate Debbie Ngarewa-Packer says the policy will address Aotearoa's low-wage economy. "Aotearoa has an economy and social security system that is broken, and that has never worked for Mori. We must ensure that everyone has enough to live on. Lifting whnau out of poverty is impossible if they do not have adequate incomes to survive with an ever-increasing cost of living," she says. "Our people are contending with a low-wage economy that is increasingly comprised of insecure jobs with no guarantee of hours and pay, forcing many to work two or three jobs. Mori unemployment is double Pkeh unemployment, while Mori disproportionately work in low-wage jobs. "The Mori Party would immediately raise the minimum wage to $25 per hour to ensure that all workers are paid enough to provide for their whnau and we would legislate for an annual increase to keep up with cost of living increases." The party will remove financial penalties, sanctions, and work-test obligations if elected. It will also ensure additional grants did not need to be paid back in future and it would introduce free public transport for students at all levels. "Many students, especially Mori students, are expected to go into debt and live in poverty just to get an education. We think that is unacceptable and are committed to championing a universal student allowance, writing off student debt, and free public transport for tertiary students," Ngarewa-Packer said.

Labour's tax plan would see the top 2 percent of earners pay 39 cents on each dollar over earned over $180,000. Photo: 123rf.com The party's policy is for a 39 cent tax on each dollar earned above $180,000 which it said would affect the top 2 percent of earners. Those earning $200,000 a year are estimated to pay an extra $23 a week in tax Labour said its new policy would bring in $550 million a year, money it said was desperately needed to help weather the 1-in-100-year economic shock brought on by Covid-19. In the suburb of Karori, resident Maree winced when she thought about going without that cash. She lost her job because of Covid-19, and she and her partner are just getting by on her partner's income - which is in the new proposed bracket. "We could just survive with me not working, but now [we] are going to have to re-look at things, and maybe ... get back into the job market sooner than thought." But she said there were few jobs going in her field right now because of the pandemic. Another resident, Sarah*, said while $180,000 might seem like a lot - it did not go far in the big city. "I think 180k, if you are a single income ... it doesn't seem fair. "It is a lot of money, but then house prices have skyrocketed. We used to live in Australia and the food prices [here] are double, and power bills are double what we paid over there. Yet we earned a lot more money over there." She said she was not buying Labour's pledge not to raise income taxes again or introduce any new ones in its next term if elected. "It's just another reason not to trust a Labour government. I don't think they are being completely transparent, I think that they will increase taxes for many other pay brackets after the election." Meanwhile, Maree said she understood sacrifices were needed in these difficult times - but it would not be easy. "We'll take it on the chin, because that is kind of what the country needs right now is we need to fund all the things so we can keep fighting Covid and get on with it. "We will sort it out, we are very fortunate in that way, but it is definitely going to affect us." Elsewhere in Wellington many people spoken to by RNZ said they were happy to hear the top earners could be chipping in a little extra. Western suburbs resident David said: "richer people have a greater social responsibility to the greater good of the people. "Good on Labour, or good on any [party] that has the courage to [increase taxes for the well off]. But there was dismay from others who thought Labour had blown a chance to do something big. One woman did not mince words. "I'm very very disappointed ... [because] it is all [such] small thinking. "I think they are tinkering and they are not looking at the really big issues. And the big issues are all the buggers who don't actually ... pay tax at all because of their various trusts and so on." In the southern suburb of Newtown, Joel Ewan said the policy epitomised Labour's approach - big talk about transformation that failed to fully deliver in action. "That's kind of their classic thing isn't it - they could have gone a bit further but they're a bit scared to. "Like the capital gains thing, they were sort of going to do it then they chickened out because they did not want to alienate a bunch of people. "I feel like that's kind of what people expect them to do, it would be nice if they were a bit more radical." If elected, Labour plans for the policy to come into effect by next April. *name changed

NZ First leader Winston Peters visiting the Tiwai Point smelter. Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon NZ First leader Winston Peters met workers at the plant this morning and told them they needed to back his party if they want their jobs and futures secured. Today was Peters' second trip to the deep south to meet with Tiwai Point workers and promise them a future at the smelter. In July, Rio Tinto announced production would end in August next year, putting more than 2000 jobs at risk. Peters says the smelter is the most eco-friendly in the world and there is no reason why it cannpt continue operating - something he says he will make happen if back in government. "Now the whole narrative's going to change. But I don't expect to be standing around any negotiation table having an argument about this matter - and that's a bottom line," he says. Workers at the site questioned why Peters was making promises so late in the piece. Engineer Richard Snoek says next year's deadline is approaching fast. "My frustration is around why wasn't something done earlier while he's still in government, to be able to get us over the line and get us to the point where we can feel safe and secure in our jobs," he says.

Both parties have made their own commitments to Tiwai Point, but with an eventual outcome that the smelter will close. Peters says his plan is a two-decade one and there is no reason why the business cannot continue to successfully operate if negotiations with Rio Tinto, power companies and Transpower are done right. But he says workers and the people of Southland need to back his party in big numbers and give him the leverage to negotiate on their behalf in a future government.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson campaigning in Tauranga. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas The party has released its tax policy and the new top rate of 39 percent on earnings over $180,000 is the sole change. Tax rates for companies and trusts would not change. The policy is forecast to generate $550 million of revenue a year. Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson said the policy is about maintaining investment in crucial services, while keeping tax rates exactly the same as they are now for 98 percent of people. "Our plan strikes a balance as we recover from Covid-19. It will avoid the cuts to services being suggested by the National Party, and also help keep a lid on debt as we support the economic recovery from a 1-in-100 year shock. "The necessary borrowing for the Covid-19 response meant we could fund emergency measures like the wage subsidy, which protected 1.7 million jobs and gave businesses and workers confidence during lockdown. But we have to be careful about not running up more debt than necessary for our recovery." Robertson said the new rate would cost an extra $23 a week for those earning $200,000. "We know from the experience of other countries - like Australia, Canada and the UK - that their economies grow strongly when higher earners are paying tax rates above 39 percent. When New Zealand previously had a 39 percent top rate, it certainly didn't stop GDP from growing at annual rates of three percent and four percent," he said. Labour is also promising to continue work with the OECD to find a solution to the issue of multi-national corporations not paying their share of tax. "Labour will continue to work to get an international agreement that will see a comprehensive regime for multinational corporations to pay their fair share. But we also need to be prepared to put in place our own rules to ensure fairness, if that agreement is not possible," Robertson said. He said Labour would be prepared to implement a Digital Services Tax (DST). "Current projections from IRD estimate a DST will raise between $30m and $80m of revenue a year," he said. Labour's opponents say more tax is not the answer to the economic challenges facing New Zealand. "No country's ever taxed its way out of recession," National's Paul Goldsmith says. "And this is classic Labour Party policy, spend more, tax more." The projected revenue of $550m a year will not make a dent in the forecast deficit of $28 billion this year, he says . "And there's a very big question as to how much actual revenue will be gained because this will be great for tax planners and accountants to work their way around." Goldsmith also warned this is "just the beginning". "There's every indication that a government that can't control its spending and manage its finances will eventually come after more and more New Zealanders." Robertson is promising no other increases or new taxes, but was asked whether that would stand if Labour needed to negotiate post election for support, with a party like the Greens, that has a more aggressive tax policy. "This is the policy that Labour is campaigning on and we will only implement the changes that are in this policy," he said. Greens co-leader James Shaw says Labour's policy does not address "the growing wealth gap and inequality in Aotearoa", or help pay for the Covid response. "The Greens believe we should ask those who are benefiting the most to chip in a bit of what they've gained to help the people who need support during this crisis. "We know that a huge accelerator of this inequality is our broken tax system that taxes people who earn but not people who own," Shaw says . His party is campaigning on a "wealth tax": 1 percent of net worth of more than $1m; and 2 percent over $2m, plus the creation of two new top income tax bands. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern has ruled out ever introducing a capital gains tax; but that policy, excluding the family home, is still on the Greens' manifesto. "What is being proposed by Labour is long overdue, but it is tinkering that won't address the long-term challenges facing Aotearoa. It shows the importance of having the Greens around the table of the next government," Shaw said. The party also supports environmental taxes: "Taxing of pollution and those who profit from our shared natural resources, like water, is essential to build a more environmentally sustainable economy," he says. Paul Goldsmith, left, and James Shaw are both objecting to Labour's tax plan. Photo: RNZ / Stuff Robertson had some criticism of his own for National, saying Labour's plan "stands in contrast to a chaotic and desperate National Party who are simultaneously promising large, uncosted policies and talking about a debt target that will require $80b of cuts to essential services like health and education". Goldsmith says that's Labour "flailing around ... feeling the pressure because as a government, they haven't really delivered on the economy". "We're losing jobs and New Zealand is dealing with mass unemployment, and they don't have a clear plan to get growth going again. And that's what we're focused on," he says. National's tax policy promises income threshold adjustments for inflation, no new taxes, a repeal of the Auckland fuel tax, and depreciation write-off rules for new business assets, under the party's BusinessStart scheme. ACT leader David Seymour said the new rate announced by Labour would raise little revenue and describes it as "divisive populism". "Jacinda Ardern likes to say we're all in this together, but Labour is picking on a small group of New Zealanders to fund the Covid-19 recovery. "Labour is telling young New Zealanders 'if you study hard, get good grades, get a good job, save money, and invest wisely, we'll tax you harder' - that's the wrong message," Seymour says.

The Labour leader had morning tea with the first responders on what is the nine-month anniversary of the tragedy. Whakatne Hospital ED clinical lead Dr Tamsin Davies choked back tears as she recalled that day. She said the horrors of the day are etched into her memory. "I think that you wouldn't be human if it wasn't. I think it's not just us as the hospital staff that it will have a lasting effect on, I think it's the whole country," she said. Ardern met with first responders at the Whakatne Library and Exhibition Centre. She told them that the extreme care they showed to victims has meant families overseas feel a strong connection to New Zealand. "And in some cases they have said if they were to lose a loved one anywhere that this is the place that they would want them to be safe and held and cared for," she said. One hospital worker told Ardern that the journey to recovery for them is ongoing and that it has been hijacked by Covid-19. "It is totally understandable given the trauma of that event, and it was incredibly traumatic for those involved, that it is still so raw and as they've said they've had the double whammy of Covid on top as well," she said. Jacinda Ardern also visited the Whakatne Mill during her visit to the town that has been hit hard by both the Whakaari / White Island eruption and Covid-19. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas When asked whether she would support a Royal Commission into the disaster, Ardern said she felt the WorkSafe and coronial inquiries needed to run their course. She believed a Royal Commission would duplicate much of that work. However, National leader Judith Collins today promised there would be a Royal Commission if she was prime minister. She said given the "magnitude" of the disaster she believed it needed to have that "level of oversight". "I think it deserves it. It is a huge loss of people and massive injuries to others whose lives were saved. I think there should be one into it, I think it's something New Zealanders would want to see," Collins said. Mayor Judy Turner said today's visit from Ardern meant a lot to the first responders. "They haven't forgotten what they saw and what they had to do. And sometimes somebody just saying 'we know that was hard and we're grateful for what you did' is really comforting," she said. Mark Inman, who lost his brother Hayden Marshall-Inman in the eruption, said this tragedy has brought the already tight knit community closer together. He said finding closure has been hard, because his brother's body has never been recovered. But he said every 9th of the month a group gathers on the beach to remember him. "Life throws you challenges at times and this is one of them. It's a moment of time in life that you're just going to have to stay strong and remember, and it's about remembering all the good times, it's about remembering who Hayden was and what Whakaari's about," he said. Inman said Covid-19 has dealt another blow to the community and he thinks it will unfortunately impact plans for marking the one-year anniversary for many of the international families. "That will be tough for them. I know my sister can't make it out, she's in Vancouver, so that will be tough," he said. The fallout from the eruption and then Covid-19 has hit the local tourism industry hard. Mark Inman says his sister will not make it to New Zealand from Canada as the family marks the one-year anniversary since the death of their brother. Photo: AFP Diveworks Charters owner Steph Vandusschoten said while now is always a quiet period - they didn't make enough over summer to see them through winter. Her husband has had to pick up extra work cleaning sewers through the council's Kia Kaha programme. "We're really, really thankful because we've got food on the table, so we're happy," she said. She said while they are holding on to a piece of string, she has decided to be positive. "When we're out on the boat in certain parts of the season you see these spiders that fly on a piece of string, they come from Australia. And I'm thinking well if they can hold onto that piece of string, we can hold onto our piece of string." Vandusschoten said she is feeling optimistic that when summer comes New Zealanders will flock to explore their own backyard and help keep businesses like hers afloat. Also today, the Labour Party has released its tax policy and is promising to increase tax on the country's highest 2 percent of earners and close loopholes so multi-nationals pay their fair share of tax. The new top rate of 39 percent on earnings over $180,000 is the sole change. Tax rates for companies and trusts would not change. The policy is forecast to generate $550 million of revenue a year. Labour's finance spokesperson Grant Robertson said the policy's about maintaining investment in crucial services, while keeping tax rates exactly the same as they are now for the vast majority of New Zealanders. He said there'd be no other new taxes, or increases under a Labour government. Ardern said the tax policy released provides certainty. "This is the totality of our tax policy," she said. "It's about choosing an option that's best for New Zealand in this time." Ardern said the tax policy will only affect few New Zealanders while ensuring the government can fund high quality health and education. "This is a really difficult time in New Zealand's history and we've chosen an option that we feel balances people's need for certainty right now." On Covid-19, Ardern said any countries contact tracing process come up against issues from time to time.

Labour's Finance Minister Grant Robertson, Green Party co-leader James Shaw, NZ First Party leader Winston Peters, National Party leader Judith Collins and ACT Party leader David Seymour. Photo: RNZ The Covid-19 response has already cost New Zealand billions of dollars, but political parties are still announcing policies with hefty price tags. Labour's accusing National of gearing up to slash public services in pursuit of its debt target, with National hitting back at the vast amounts of money being borrowed and spent by its opponent. The campaign has roared into gear and politicians are adjusting to the new way of campaigning, with masks at hand and social distancing a new, and challenging, requirement. But what's not new this election is the fierce debate over how each party would spend New Zealanders' hard-earned taxpayer dollars, and how much more they're going to borrow. In 2017 there was the $11.7 billion fiscal hole accusation from National, and the attempt by Labour to present itself as a credible manager of the economy. In 2020 the shoe is on the other foot for Labour's finance spokesperson, Grant Robertson. "A major political party like National has a responsibility to say what the cost of policies that they're announcing are, and I think this is the chaotic state of a party that's had three leaders since Covid began, isn't sure of its policy footing, and is putting out things that just fuel uncertainty." National's Judith Collins says her party will put out a fully-costed plan after the books are opened up for the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update (PREFU) next week. It's not just National who should be scrutinised for its spending, she says, with "irresponsible" government spending "loading a lot of extra debt and cost onto small businesses". "What I think is really important to understand is that we cannot simply borrow our way out of a recession, what we need to do is build our way out of it." A more worrying proposition if you add in the Greens, says Collins, a prospect that "should scare the basically the bejesus out of people, frankly". "National are doing down their brand when they say that they're good fiscal managers if they can't even provide the electorate with proper numbers for this election campaign," shot back Greens co-leader James Shaw. The accusation the Greens are poor economic managers was "always a caricature", says Shaw, during his first media outing since having to apologise profusely for backing nearly $12 million of funding for the Green School. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters says his party also intends to release its full spending plan and manifesto after the pre-election update. "The first thing you got to know, is the latest updated information. I know others have got all their costings out there, now how they did that, I wouldn't know. But we want to wait until the PREFU comes out, and we'll know what we're dealing with." Debt is another major economic black cloud; net debt that pre-Covid-19 had sat about 20 percent of the value of the economy will hit a peak of 53.6 percent of GDP in 2023, and is projected to sit above 40 percent well into the 2030s. National wants to pay it back more quickly than Labour - down to 30 percent within a decade. Robertson says that means slashing about $80b out of the budget. "What that's about is not increasing health spending to keep up with inflation or population increase. It's not spending in the education sector, to make sure we've got the resources for the number of children who are coming in. "So they actually have to be upfront about this is no free lunch here." That was dismissed by Collins as "PR spin" from a "finance minister who doesn't understand that money needs to be borrowed, needs to be paid back. "We're really focused on making sure that where we borrow, we're not just flittering around way, we're really, really focused on making sure that we when we borrow that we are building for the future, as well as today." Debt's also on the mind of ACT leader David Seymour, who calls the current pathway "fiscal child abuse". "I think we've been lulled into a false sense of security by interest rates that are low now, but may not be in years to come. "It's people currently at intermediate school who will have the biggest cost from this and they don't even know the decisions being made for them," he says. The party's Debt Destroyer calculator will help people see the true impact of various on the amount this country will have to borrow, Seymour says. Next Wednesday, PREFU will be released by Treasury, giving an overall predication of the how the economy will perform, including the speed of recovery, the numbers of people heading for the unemployment queue and those debt tracks. Before that though, voters will hear about Labour's tax plan, to be announced later this morning.

Harvesting of asparagus is starting to begin. Photo: RNZ/ Cosmo Kentish-Barnes Visitors and temporary migrants trapped in this country by the restrictions on travel will now have their visas extended to give them more time to organise flights home. But Horticulture NZ chief executive Mike Chapman said these changes did little to help people working in the horticultural and wine sectors. He said the sector was coming up to a busy time. "We're just starting harvest with strawberries and asparagus, that has quite a significant demand for workers," he said. "Then as we come into Christmas, of course, cherries get picked and now we're coming into a period where we need thousands of workers." In July, the horticultural industry warned it might have to cut back on the harvest if the governement did not move quickly to head off a critical labour shortage in spring. At that time, former Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway promised the horticultural industry that it would be able to recruit up to 14,400 registered seasonal workers from Pacific Islands later this year. Kiwifruit producer Seeka chief executive Michael Franks said a lot was at stake for an industry facing a critical labour shortage. The kiwifruit industry earned $2.3 billion in exports in the year to March, while the apple and pear industry earned $878 million, other fruits and nuts earned $3.5b and vegetables earned $505.5m. Franks said most New Zealanders were not interested in working in the industry long enough to gain the necessary experience. "People come and go, they don't stay," he said, adding the company was forced to recruit more than 900 New Zealanders to fill 240 jobs during the Covid-19 lockdown, because they kept quitting. It was announced this week that those already in the country with visitor visas due to expire before the end of October would have their visa automatically extended for five months. Temporary migrants unable to leave due to international travel restrictions would receive a new two-month Covid-19 short-term visa, which would kick in when their current visa expired. Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi said the changes were specifically to help those people already in New Zealand with no immediate option to return home. "Temporary migrants need to have a valid visa to remain lawfully in New Zealand, otherwise they are required to leave the country," he said. "However, temporary migrants who choose to apply for the Covid-19 short-term visitor visa will not need to meet other usual visitor visa requirements, such as demonstrating that they have enough money to support their stay, having existing onward travel arrangements, or that they've met time limits for their stay in New Zealand."

The Gulf Livestock 1. Photo: Splash247.com The Gulf Livestock 1 left Napier on 14 August with 43 crew members, including two New Zealanders, and 5800 cattle on-board. The vessel sent a distress signal during the early hours of Wednesday morning and has not yet been located. Japanese rescue crews have so far found three survivors - two Filipinos and a third person who later died. Damien O'Connor Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas So far, Minister of Agriculture Damien O'Connor has distanced himself from the incident, declining all media requests. But he did issue a statement saying his thoughts were with the friends and family of the crew, and that officials were investigating. Currently, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is leading a review of New Zealand's live stock export rules, A conditional ban on the export of cattle, sheep, goats and deer for slaughter was introduced in 2007. The current review is looking at strengthening existing standards to a total or conditional ban on some or all parts of the livestock export trade. The Green Party spokesperson on animal welfare, Gareth Hughes, said the incident showed New Zealand must stop exporting live stock for breeding. He told RNZ's Checkpoint on Thursday night the animals suffered from distress for weeks at sea and many farmers did not feel it was economic. "It's something I don't think we should be doing," he said. Hughes said he had urged O'Connor to act with haste. "I'm disappointed the review has taken so long to get to this point but I've been clear the Green Party's preference is for a total ban on live exports." Animal activist group SAFE is calling on O'Connor to be held accountable for the incident. The organisation's campaign manager, Marianne Macdonald, said O'Connor needed to front up and take responsibility. "The minister has failed and this is unnecessary suffering he has allowed to happen," she said Macdonald said O'Connor needed to publish the review into live shipments before the election. "He needs to act to ban live exports quickly to stop another tragedy happening like this." The National Party is staying tight lipped over whether there is a need for a total ban on livestock exports. Agriculture spokesperson David Bennett said now was not the time to blame anyone, but that there needed to be an investigation into what had happened with Livestock Gulf 1. Gareth Hughes, left, and David Bennett Photo: RNZ He said there were issues that needed to be addressed around live shipments before the party took a stance. Bennett said the National Party would form its view on MPI's advice from the review. He said MPI needed to prioritise a new investigation into Livestock Gulf 1 over the current report into live shipments. New Zealand First said it supported live shipments and did not want a total ban. Agriculture spokesperson Mark Paterson said the party supported the review currently under way. Paterson agreed there should be an investigation into the sinking of Livestock Gulf 1 but said live shipments had large economic benefits. "It's a $300 million a year industry and that's vital especially when we need a every dollar we can get," he said. The ACT Party also did not support a total ban on livestock exports, saying it would be a huge mistake. The party's rural spokesperson and Northland dairy farmer, Mark Cameron, said there were questions that needed to be answered by the shipping company as to what had gone wrong in international waters. He said the economic and trade benefits of live export were too great to lose in the current climate. "To line up and based on emotion create a reality that has the potential to destroy 10s if not 100s of millions of dollars would be a mistake," he said. Cameron said New Zealand farmers were at risk of copping unnecessary blame over the incident with Livestock Gulf 1.

"This is a significant investment in our ongoing efforts to keep all New Zealanders safe," Salesa said. Customs is one of the government agencies working with the Ministry of Health and Defence Force to enforce the current Covid-19 border orders. Salesa said the money would ensure there were more staff to protect the country's maritime border. It includes $40m in new funding and $10m in contingency. Minister for Customs Jenny Salesa. Photo: RNZ Pacific / Sela Jane Hopgood So far, Customs has been redeploying staff from within to the sea ports, she said. "However increasing the overall level of staff at the sea ports demonstrates the Government's commitment to standing up a permanent and long term system of defence to keep Covid out. "While ports represent a lower risk than some other border-facing facilities the Government is nevertheless taking it seriously. "This will ensure there are more Customs staff to protect our maritime border, while also allowing Customs to continue its other important work, such as protecting New Zealand from illicit drugs, facilitating trade and travel, and collecting Crown revenue." In July 2020, 277 commercial vessels arrived at New Zealand's ports, with about 5700 crew on-board.

Aro Valley debate attendees practice their water pistol skills. Photo: Hamish Cardwell / RNZ Strict social distancing made the Wellington Central debate a slightly more subdued affair than normal, but there was still plenty more entertainment than you're average campaign event. Usually about 100 people pack the Aro Valley hall with hundreds more spilling out into the park to hear the local candidates pitch themselves to their inner city Wellington constituents. Last night numbers were strictly capped at 50 - plus candidate supporters and the media - with all the physical distancing and contact tracing we've come to expect this election season. Green Party candidate and co-leader James Shaw noted the more muted vibe and acknowledged the efforts of a lone heckler shouting from outside while doing some classic political pandering. "This guy is doing a pretty good effort at filling in for the 200 people who aren't normally in the room. "The Aro Valley town hall [debate] I think is basically we have elections in Aotearoa/New Zealand - so that we can have this particular piece of political theatre." The candidates are given five minutes to make their opening remarks - any longer and the water pistols come out. ACT candidate Brooke van Velden pushed hers beyond the limit, and her raincoat came in handy as the sound of the pounded piano signalled her soaking should commence. Despite the levity of the event, it is still politics - and it wasn't long before the political hits started to be made. TOP Party candidate Abe Gray took glee in sticking the boot into the Green Party. "TOP - the Opportunities Party - is ... a party that is forged in Wellington Central, it is kind of like made for Wellington Central. "It is like a cooler, hipper version of the Green Party that likes evidence and science and stuff." Green Party candidate and co-leader James Shaw. Photo: Hamish Cardwell / RNZ And the National Party candidate Nicola Willis softened James Shaw up with some kind words about his bipartisan work on the Zero Carbon Act before socking him over the Green School debacle. The incumbent and Labour Party candidate Grant Robertson pointed out Shaw had squandered a chance to take a crack at the Green's nemesis at the Cabinet table. "I thought James you missed an opportunity to be funny there. "Because I thought - when the question was 'what's the barrier to decarbonisation' - I thought you might say 'New Zealand First'. But you didn't." Shaw shot back: "I'm done talking about New Zealand First." The lightening question round loosened the audience up, and their clear favourite was the youngest candidate - the 18-year-old independent Jesse Richardson. His platform of environmental issues and youth representation resonated with the young crowd. Independent candidate Jesse Richardson. Photo: Hamish Cardwell / RNZ And he made probably the best - and darkest - joke of the night. "It's kind of a shame this is the round where we are supposed to try and be funny because this is probably the one issue I don't really have any jokes on. "Like: 'knock knock, who's there, climate change'." He drew spontaneous applause time and again, with shouts of amour meeting cries about the barriers to diverse representation in Parliament. Audience member Emily said she had a really good time. "I think it was really fun, it was my first time. [My friend] has been before so she set us up with really high hopes for a lot of heckling. "I think there would have been a little bit more if not for Covid." The country goes to the polls on 17 October.

Judith Collins campaigning in Hawke's Bay on Tuesday. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone National pledged to immediately begin the installation of air conditioning - but also to rebuild the main block and expand the emergency department. In March the DHB revealed spending in the previous year of nearly $12,000 on ice blocks and fans for staff working in sweltering summer heat with no air-conditioning. The DHB said the estimated $7m cost of retrofitting air conditioning in the wards was in the DHB's capital plan but no date had been set for when it might go ahead. "We have obligations as employers in government to our staff and health and safety would make it absolutely a requirement that our staff are not working in 30 degree heat in Hawke's Bay Hospital in outdated buildings when there is a fix that could be done," Collins told Morning Report. "That is actually a requirement. I am surprised anyone hasn't taken any sort of claim about it to the DHB." Collins said it was a good use of money given the main wing would take some years to rebuild. "Is it a good spend of our money to care about our staff? Actually I think it is." Collins reiterated her party will put out full costings for its campaign pledges after the books are opened up for the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update (PREFU) next week. She said a few policies may change "a bit" given the party doesn't have access to the PREFU yet. But its policy on combating methamphetamine addiction, where it is pledging more detox beds at DHBs, would stay. "Being able to address something of that magnitude, of that harm, for $63 million over four years ... most people would think that that was a very reasonable spend." Collins said it would be going "a bit too far" to evict people from state houses if they had used meth. If state houses were being used for dealing meth it is breaking the social contract, she said. "But if we're dealing with people who have an addiction and they are trying to deal with that addiction and they want to get help I think we've got to be much kinder about that and understand that addictions are a serious issue." Asked if National got it wrong when in government over evicting state house tenants if their homes tested positive for methamphetamine, Collins said the policy needed to be refreshed as more was known and the situation changed.

And the New Zealand Drug Foundation director says voters will be reassured by the reports' clear picture of what cannabis legalisation would look like. A referendum on whether recreational cannabis use should become legal will take place on 17 October. The Ministry of Justice commissioned two reports by BERL, a consultancy advising government, to help draft development of the Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill. The reports claim decriminalising cannabis would create up to 5000 new jobs and see as many as 419 cannabis stores open. [https://berl.co.nz/sites/default/files/2020-09/Market-structure-for-recreational-cannabis-PROACTIVE-FINAL.pdf They also claim] a change in law would annually harvest $335 million in GST, $640m from excise tax and a further $440m from a harm reduction levy. The report also predicts a short-term spike in cannabis use, with a predicted 30 percent increase in consumption across a 25 percent increase in the number of users. That was expected to tail off over a period of three to five years. It also estimated 134 retail stores, 59 licensed premises and 227 combined stores (which sell only cannabis and cannabis related accessories) would open to cater to the demand. The National Party's spokesman for drug reform, Nick Smith, said these predicted outcomes would concern New Zealanders. "I don't think they will be seduced by the billion-odd dollars of revenue that may end up going to government," Smith said. Meanwhile, the New Zealand Drug Foundation executive director, Ross Bell, said: "I think voters, when they look at this kind of information, will be reassured that legalisation is not this out-of-control beast. What is out of control is what we're currently doing, where we leave cannabis in the hands of organised crime."

In July Rio Tinto announced production would end at the smelter in August 2021, putting more than 2500 jobs on the line. Later that month Peters travelled to Tiwai and assured workers there would be buyers lining up if Rio Tinto chose to leave Southland. At the time, he told workers, "if we go on having a say in the government, in the future, then we commit to a 20-year agreement with a 10-year review, with a fair electricity cost based on the cost of supply and a respectable margin.'' But speaking in nearby Bluff yesterday Peters said other political parties had subsequently "complicated and compromised'' his promise. Winston Peters in Bluff while on the NZ First campaign tour Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon ''We had a whole lot of copycats get in there and complicate it and compromise it by saying it's a five-year plan, which is absolute nonsense," Peters says. ''We've got a two-decade strategy based on a fair pricing regime, and making sure the workers and the province of Southland gets a fair go this time." The New Zealand First "Back Your Future" bus tour is in Southland this week and was pulling up at the smelter at 7.30am to speak with workers and reiterate the party's plan to save thousands of jobs. Winston Peters at Bluff during the New Zealand First campaign tour in Southland Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon Peters says it's unbelievable the support Labour, National and even ACT have thrown at Tiwai Point since his initial trip. ''I'll be there with the staff to tell them about the one party you can trust on this matter - not the Johnny-come-lately's who have crucified this industry and these workers - 2500 in the case of Invercargill and Southland and are now trying to pose as their friends,'' he says. "No one can trust the other parties on this matter.'' He rubbished the Labour promise of a $100 million Just Transition package - a deal New Zealand First was asked to back as part of the coalition but refused to do so, ensuring it became a a campaign issue.

Green Party co-leader James Shaw meeting with students at the Victoria University of Wellington bar on 8 September, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver Shaw attended a Wellington Central debate at the Victoria University of Wellington before meeting with students afterwards. Covid-19 meant that the debate was far from the packed venues usually experienced in the lead up to an election, instead less than 40 people sat in on today's debate, while it was livestreamed on social media. There were a few technical difficulties along the way, but Shaw said he was adjusting to the new norm. "It is quite a weird experience as a candidate because a lot of what you do is connect with people in the audience, and when they're down the barrel of the camera it's obviously quite a different experience, but we've all got to adapt to the experiences we find ourselves in and make the best of it," he said. It came as no surprise student issues were the main focus of the debate. Shaw said the biggest problem facing students is living costs. "$250 a week is not enough to live on, you need at least a minimum of $325 a week, so this election we are campaigning on a guaranteed minimum income for people who need it," he said. "Obviously that's people who are unemployed or under-employed. But that also includes students both undergrad and postgrad students." The Wellington Central debate was livestreamed with less than 40 people present due to Covid restrictions. Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver The topic of education landed the co-leader in hot water in recent weeks, when he championed for almost $12 million in funding to go to the private Green School in Taranaki - a move at odds with the party's stance on private schools. He has since apologised, calling it an error of judgement, and saying the money will most likely be in the form of a loan rather than grant. He was hopeful it won't be casting too much of a shadow on campaigning. "I think when people look at our track record of action on climate change, on conservation and on ending inequality in this country, I think that people will be able to make their own mind up about whether or not we should be a part of the next government." With polls having the Green Party teetering on the 5 percent threshold, the party is preparing to fight tooth and nail for votes. However, Shaw was at ease meeting students at the uni bar, as he told students about his past experience of campaigning at pubs in London.

Leader Winston Peters said his party had long supported training programmes to build and improve the skills of prisoners to help them rejoin society. "We have supported the Howard League's prison drivers programme, adult literacy classes and the Greyhound Great Mates Prison Programme. ''If elected, we pledge to work with Corrections, and fund more of these and similar programmes across the country," Peters said.

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425511/labour-promises-action-on-contactless-payment-charges|2020-09-08|Labour is promising to extend the Small Business Cashflow Loan Scheme and increase the interest free period. Leader Jacinda Ardern unveiled a package of policies alongside Labour's Small Business spokesperson Stuart Nash, and Finance Spokesperson Grant Robertson while campaigning in Tauranga today. Nash said SME's are at the centre of Labour's plan for economic recovery. If re-elected Labour would extend the loan scheme for three years, and the interest free period to two years. It would also investigate more permanent finance support for small businesses. "Our track record of support for SMEs demonstrates we are prepared to respond quickly to keep the engine room of our economy humming. We are now moving to the next phase to help small and medium enterprises adapt and innovate to the new business landscape," Nash said. "Improved cash flow support, new ways to drive digital transformation, and lowering costs and regulatory impacts are at the heart of our plans to help business bounce back faster. "Our message to small businesses is that we have got your back," he said. Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern with finance spokesperson Grant Roberston and small business spokesperson Stuart Nash. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Labour also promised to "tighten regulations" around merchant service fees charged by banks to retailers. "Retailers are estimated to pay on average $13,000 more than their Australian counterparts each year on merchant service fees. This needs to change. "The point where customers transact with businesses is a source of both health and economic concern. Contactless payments give customers and businesses greater peace of mind as we all work to eliminate the virus", Nash said. Labour also pledged more support for digital transformation for SMEs through a $2500 Digital Training Voucher and to promote digital commerce, like e-invoicing. Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern unveiled a package of policies alongside Small Business spokesperson Stuart Nash in Tauranga on 8 September, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Nash said the party would also mitigate compliance costs and overhaul the Accounting Income Method tax regime. "Central government regulations are also in the frame as we undertake to put small businesses at the heart of decision-making. A dedicated cross-government unit will be tasked with ensuring all proposed new regulations are considered from the perspective of SMEs. "Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and will continue to be at the centre of our policies. We will keep up the momentum of recovery," Nash said. Advocacy group Small Business Voice chief executive Max Whitehead said the move to slash payWave fees was well-overdue. He said merchant service fees were frustrating and in some cases crippling for businesses dealing with the pressures of the Covid-19 pandemic - and in comparison with Australia, he said it was clear New Zealand business were "getting abused". "Small businesses are really doing their best out there to help our economy, to pay their taxes and to get our country back on its feet again. It's those silly little things like this where people are exploiting small businesses, because they don't have the strength of a big business, that is really costing our nation right now," he said. "Small businesses, banks, the government, everyone should be saying, look guys, let's try make business easier for small businesses right now. So I think the pressure should be put on across the spectrum." Retail NZ chief executive Greg Harford said changes brought about by Visa and Mastercard last month had already trickled down to businesses and made it a little bit easier for them to afford merchant service fees. But he welcomed the idea of the government playing more of a regulatory role. Greg Harford. Photo: Supplied "It is good news for retailers and any business that accepts card payments, that there is likely to be more downwards pressure on fees associated with accepting them. The cost of accepting credit and contactless debit transactions in New Zealand has been historically two to three times more than it has been in places like Australia and the UK," he said. However, he said today's announcement was "pretty general" and he looked forward to seeing how it progressed. "I think there is quite a lot of detail that will need to be worked through about exactly how this is going to work," he said. National says Labour's promise to reduce paywave fees for small businesses is a "fig leaf". National leader Judith Collins says while they support the move - this doesn't cover costs imposed under Labour that are hurting small business - like the minimum wage increase, fuel taxes, and 90-day trials. She says small businesses are doing it extremely tough right now and they need more support. National's finance spokesperson, Paul Goldsmith, says: "While small businesses will welcome any support from the government, what they really need is an understanding of the pressure they are under. "Small businesses are concerned about the mounting debts they have as a result of subsequent lockdowns and meeting their payroll. "National knows small businesses need cash flow and support to invest in their businesses. We have recently released a comprehensive policy package including a number of tax changes to reduce the cost of compliance on small businesses."

In a statement this morning, National said it would rebuild the main block of Hawke's Bay Hospital, with design and development beginning in 2021 and an aim to have diggers on site by 2025. It would also expand the emergency department to cater for growing need and immediately begin the installation of air conditioning. "We're committed to ensuring our public health system is delivering for you, your children and your family," said National leader Judith Collins. "These improvements will improve the lives of many New Zealanders." National Party leader Judith Collins.

Over the summer, fans and iceblocks were handed out to staff and tinted window film installed to help beat the heat on the wards. Resident Doctors' Association spokesperson Deborah Powell said the heat was often so unbearable it had become a health and safety issue. However, Hawke's Bay DHB has said that the best solution for air conditioning could still be 10 years away, despite urgent concerns. In July, the government announced a $14.2 million package to redevelop radiology and surgery at the hospital, but there was no mention of new air conditioning funding. Tukutuki MP Lawrence Yule.

"This investment in Hawke's Bay Hospital, combined with the already announced $300 million roading investment, is the largest ever investment in the Hawke's Bay region," he said. National's health spokesperson Shane Reti said Hawke's Bay was a rapidly growing part of New Zealand and the hospital needed to grow to match this.

Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon Covid-19 level 2 restrictions have made this year's election campaign an anti-social nightmare for politicians and Winston Peters' bread and butter politics of town hall meetings are a no-go zone. That means socially distanced walking around streets across the country is the only way to meet as many people as possible between now and 17 October. But in order to do that well, the leader has to be prepared to bowl up to every person he meets and make them talk to him, whether they're voting for his party or not. Peters delivers a speech well but that's an entirely different ball game to small talk on the street with strangers and if Dunedin on Monday was anything to go by then he'll need to learn fast. Peters was flanked by Southland-based MP Mark Patterson and Palmerston North-based MP Darroch Ball. Neither are big chatters so the combination resulted in a fair bit of awkward silence. Peters would do well to get Tracey Martin, Ron Mark or Jenny Marcroft on the bus tour with him - they're all sociable, natural conversationalists. Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon But it's not only New Zealand First dealing with this problem. Both Labour's Jacinda Ardern and National's Judith Collins have had to field questions about their own social distancing on the campaign trail, after Collins was filmed playing with a baby who started sucking her fingers, and Ardern was seen in Auckland getting a little too close with well-wishers. Monday marked the first official day where all political parties were out on the road. In fact Peters had beaten them all to it - ditching the last day of Parliament on Wednesday and heading south on the ferry to get the West Coast of the South Island and Christchurch under his belt before hitting Dunedin. Peters admits this form of campaigning is not easy. "It is hard, but we're doing more and better than anyone else,'' he says. "No one is out there going to all the small parts of this country and by the time they wake up the campaign will be over.'' Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon He says there is no "comparative base" as a campaign has never been run under such circumstances, so it is impossible to say whether he is meeting fewer people as a result. Given there has been no cases of Covid-19 in the South Island since restrictions increased in Auckland, Peters is questioning why it is still in level 2. He says he had expressed that to the prime minister also. There were no policy announcements from Peters on his Dunedin jaunt, but he says there will be one a day from now on. For the most part, the few people Peters came across were friendly and happy to chat. The most human moment of the day was when he interrupted two Otago University students playing table tennis and asked if he could have a go. Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon They were happy to oblige and for about one minute Peters looked to be enjoying himself. Then it was onto neighbouring Mosgiel where he spoke to a couple of shop owners and a busker. Peters probably felt most at ease when he had a shouting match with a truck driver. The middle-aged man leant out his window as he drove past Peters on the street and yelled, ''too old Winston, too old''. An unperturbed Peters yelled back from the footpath, ''I know you are''.

The stars of Matariki. Photo: Wikimedia Commons / Filip Loli Ardern made the pledge to mark the start of the Mori New Year while campaigning in Rotorua this morning. "As I've travelled around New Zealand I've heard the calls for Matariki to become a public holiday - its time has come. It will also be a confidence boost that many sectors need right now. "Matariki will be a distinctly New Zealand holiday and a time for reflection, celebration, and to look to the future as we take increasing pride in our unique national identity," Ardern said. The last public holiday introduced was Waitangi Day nearly 50 years ago. This move would mean New Zealand would have 12 public holidays and it would break up the winter period. A group of experts will help determine an exact date but Ardern expected it would always fall on a Monday or a Friday within Matariki. She said the new holiday would not take effect until 2022 to give businesses time to prepare. Labour Party deputy leader Kelvin Davis said a Matariki public holiday would help domestic tourism and hospitality sector. "As New Zealanders plan mid-winter getaways and will also allow the tourism industry to market Matariki globally to international travellers as a uniquely New Zealand winter experience in years to come." Davis said Matariki would be the first public holiday that recognised Mori culture and tradition. "Making Matariki a public holiday is another step forward in our partnership as a people and a further recognition of te ao Mori in our public life", he said. In May, Laura O'Connell Rapira from Action Station set up a petition urging the government to make Matariki a holiday, and has since received nearly 35,000 signatures. Mori astronomer Dr Rangi Mtmua. Photo: Waikato Museum Mori astronomer Dr Rangi Mtmua told RNZ in May that Matariki had increasingly become a part of our national identity, and making it a public holiday would encourage more people to learn about it. "Matariki traditionally was a public holiday," he said. "It was when Mori stopped working, they relaxed, they sat around, they ate together, they celebrated together. So us trying to reincorporate that into our modern society is a good thing, and I think it will help Matariki to endure." Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said she was "pleased to see Labour coming to the party", with the Greens already announcing their support for making Matariki a holiday. "The Mori New Year is a chance each year to reflect, celebrate, claim our past, and look forward. It gives us time to look up at the night sky and teach our kids about how our tpuna used the stars to give guidance in how we live our lives," Davidson said. "As well as increasing cultural awareness around our history, an extra public holiday will encourage New Zealanders to get out to the regions and support small businesses that have been hurt by the drop off in tourism." However, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters wasn't impressed. He said right now work, sacrifice and collective effort was required, not another holiday. "Now is not the time, when we are in the throes of huge financial challenges to start thinking about a holiday. I'm sorry, work is going to be our way out of it, working smarter and working more clever than we did in the past - but it's not leisure and holiday time," Peters said. National Party leader Judith Collins said the policy could hurt small businesses. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Collins said some of her team thought it was a great idea, but her concern was that it was another public holiday employers would have to pay for. "People need to realise too ... that when we look at anything where there's extra cost, particularly on small businesses ... it's actually having a huge effect on the attitudes of people in small businesses in particularm," she said. "We're going to have an awful lot of holidays for people that they weren't looking for - and those are unfortunately a lot of job losses." She said she would like to see the evidence the new holiday would help domestic tourism. National finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith also said the policy was "tone deaf" considering the economic situation. "More and more New Zealanders want to celebrate Matariki, but if it is to take the form of a public holiday it should replace an existing one. "A new public holiday won't mean much to the tens of thousands of families who are now on the unemployment benefit." ACT leader David Seymour accused Ardern of being in "la la land" for the policy vow. "Anybody who thinks stopping people working will boost the economy is an economic illiterate, and small and medium enterprises can ill afford even more of this meddling," Seymour said. He also questioned why Labour chose this as one of their first big campaign promises. "It would be more honest for the Labour Party to say they have no policies than fly kites such as additional public holiday as their first policy announced in an economic crisis. "There are 70,000 more people on welfare, future generations face mountains of debt, businesses are struggling to survive, and Labour's answer is a new public holiday. "If Labour wants Matariki to be public holiday, it should abolish Labour Day so businesses aren't taking on more costs."

National wants to trial a treatment programme - known as Matrix - providing wrap-around support to meth addicts, Judith Collins says. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Leader Judith Collins has spent the morning meeting with addiction advocates in Napier before unveiling the party's plan to tackle methamphetamine harm. "The use of this drug tears families apart, fuels violence, enriches criminals and destroys lives. "We cannot tolerate the continued misery this drug causes, which leads to rising levels of violence and poverty, and widespread social harm," she said. National wants to trial a treatment programme - known as Matrix - providing wrap-around support to meth addicts in their communities. The 20 week programme - developed in the United States and operating in Australia - would initially run in 11 locations. It would also ensure every district health board has at least one detox bed with a fulltime specialist to help patients break their habit. Health spokesperson Shane Reti said National will reduce demand by improving the health response and providing treatment options that are not available today. Massey University Associate Professor Chris Wilkins leads the drug research team at the SHORE and Whariki Research Centre. He welcomed National's plan. He said he liked the focus on treatment and harm reduction and improving access to treatment. "A lot of the focus is on treatment programmes, the Matrix methamphetamine treatment plan, and locating those in 11 different locations, I think that's really important because a lot of places in rural regions and smaller towns have significant methamphetamine problems but don't have good access to treatment services." Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern said the Labour-led government had already been investing in addiction programmes. "We've invested for instance and supported the drug and alcohol courts, extra beds, extra treatment across the country, we know though that there is more need out there, so that is why we will continue to invest in it," she said. Ardern said her government had also increased frontline policing, while heavily investing in support for addicts. Watch political leaders react to National's drug policy: In addition to wanting to trial a treatment programme, National is also promising to boost funding for police, customs and health authorities to identify drugs coming across the border, but hasn't said by how much. Justice spokesperson Simon Bridges said there must be a strong response from law and order agencies to disrupt those trying to bring meth into the country. Shane Reti, left, and Simon Bridges Photo: RNZ / Getty Images "We will build capacity to interdict the international crime cartels that are bringing this problem to our shores. Good intelligence and international co-operation will be a priority under National. "There can be no tolerance for the dealing and supply of methamphetamine. Those who peddle this drug are responsible for the misery and social harm it causes," he said. Collins said there is no single solution to what has become a scourge on society. "A National government will tackle this problem from all angles, addressing both demand and supply," she said. ACT leader David Seymour said in a statement he supported National's policy, but it must be funded - and ACT had the solution. He said his party's policy to make it easier for police to seize gang assets would pay for National's plan. "Earlier this year, ACT proposed changing the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act to make it easier for police to seize gang assets. We would ring-fence the proceeds from this law change and put them towards disrupting the supply of meth and reducing the harm it does," he said. "Law-abiding New Zealanders pay a third of their income in tax. Under ACT's policy, the government could take at least that much off gangs dealing illegal drugs. By 'taxing' gangs a third, we'd collect enough money to pick up the pieces of the harm they cause." The meth trade was about $500 million a year, so a third - $170m - would be enough to pay for the scheme, Seymour said.

Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, National leader Judith Collins, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, and Green co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson. Photo: RNZ The 52nd Parliament officially dissolved yesterday - a crucial milestone in kicking-off the general election process. Political parties can finally commit to campaigning after an abrupt stop, when Auckland went into level 3 lockdown and Parliament was reconvened and the election delayed. Labour's campaign chair Megan Woods said the party has been agile, reprinting materials due to the change of election date, and re-scheduling advertisements. "We've also had to think about how it is the electorate wants us to speak to them. "I don't think people just yet are ready for people to be knocking at their doors for example talking about politics, so we've got to be respectful of where people are and the kinds of ways they want to have conversations," she said. Woods said the party has already held party events online this year. She said those who innovate during this campaign will be the ones that flourish. "Politics is ultimately about a conversation, so we need to be having those conversations both online, but be flexible enough as we do move down those alert levels that we can bring people together again," she said. National's campaign chair Gerry Brownlee said while his party is using social media, they are still trying to get out to the regions. But to do that Brownlee said politicians will need to spend a lot more time in the car this election, which was evident for leader Judith Collins last week. "On Monday Judith Collins was in New Plymouth and then it was a drive down to Wellington from there because there were no flights that were suitable. "Where in the past you may have been able to fly out of a place like that to perhaps as far as Invercargill, land, then make your way back up using different flights that's no longer an option," he said. Rules on social gatherings had also been limiting for the party. "We had several meetings where we had 100 people, which is the limit, but you've a much, much bigger space and they are very spread out and the dynamic of that meeting is I think somewhat lost in that distancing," he said. ACT leader David Seymour said he held an invite only event in Nelson to abide by social gathering rules. He said while the party is doing more online, there is still a need to physically meet with voters. "It's critical to get out and actually listen to people because elections are a two way process, so we'll be doing our street corner meetings for instance, but with hand sanitiser and a QR code for people to check in when they come to a street corner or other meeting," he said. Greens co-leader Marama Davidson said her party needs to be ready to change its plans with little notice. "Honestly, I feel like we cannot plan anything in concrete these days. "We are going to be very aware that any physical larger events that we think we might organise and we've got some potential ones coming up, at a moment's notice we may need to move those to online events if we have to," she said. Davidson said there is still a lot of anxiety in her Tmaki Makaurau electorate, which is changing how she campaigns. "Our focus will be on phone calls and actually we've been having a good response to phone calling. "But that whole physical anxiety that people are having in Auckland and in South Auckland where I live in my community is a massive feature and people are just not ready to have strangers on their doorsteps at the moment," she said. But despite the setbacks, parties are ready this week to give it their all. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters will be spending most of this week travelling the South Island to meet with voters. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern will be in Rotorua today and Judith Collins in Napier. This week, ACT will be announcing its mental health policy, with David Seymour attending events in Auckland. Meanwhile, the Greens are preparing for a policy announcement later in the week.

Brooke van Velden. Photo: supplied The party's deputy leader and health spokesperson, Brooke van Velden, said the current system is a disorderly mix of funding arrangements with providers struggling to deliver a coordinated response. "Drug and alcohol abuse can destroy families and lives, and yet treatment is difficult to access and the choice of treatments don't work for everyone. "We need a new approach to addiction and mental health in this country; it's clear the status quo just isn't working," she said. Van Velden said the Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission lacked real power to improve choice or establish a clear, nationwide approach to tackling mental health and addiction. Under ACT's policy, the commission would be renamed Mental Health and Addiction New Zealand and would not be a provider of services, but rather a world-class commissioning agency that assesses individual needs and contracts the best providers for a person's therapy and care. "Any provider that meets strict criteria would be able to register with MHANZ to provide treatment and care. Funding for services would be determined by and attached to the care of individuals and their needs. "MHANZ would carefully monitor providers to ensure New Zealanders are receiving high quality care," van Velden said. She said patients would be able to choose any registered provider for their immediate care, providing greater autonomy, or be referred to a specific provider when a person lacks the capacity to make the choice themselves.

Jacinda Ardern & Paul Goldsmith. Photo: RNZ Ministry of Social Development figures show that more than 5000 New Zealanders applied for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks of August. National Party finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said the figures are a result of the latest Auckland lockdown and the wind down of the wage subsidy. Unemployment figures and the hit to the economy from Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns are actually better than predicted by the likes of ASB and other banks, but Goldsmith said "it's all relative." "At one point we thought we might be in double figures and back to Great Depression level figures, so hopefully we'll avoid the very worst but it is still very substantial." Goldsmith said there is a "real sense" there will be more job losses and the critical thing now is to think about how to create new jobs. He said the government can't carry on doing stimulus. "The best thing we can do is have an economy that's creating jobs so people can get back into work... if you want to have sustainable jobs, you really need private sector investment creating those jobs." One of National's plans, if they were to get into government, would be the ability for business to write of new investments. Another is to get within "prudent" levels of debt within a decade in case of another crisis. "The only reason we've been able to spend to the extent we have this time is because we started off with low levels of debt." Goldsmith said a National government wouldn't cut services, but wouldn't fund them at the level the current government does. The Reserve Bank has acknowledged low interest rates have bolstered house prices, which is good for confidence but not great for inequality. Goldsmith said it's an "enormous problem" worldwide. "We've had reserve banks lowering interest rates, watering the milk as I describe it, and that's led to asset price inflation everywhere. "The biggest asset New Zealanders have is their house, so I think the best response is to make sure we can build new houses." Labour leader Jacinda Ardern said the latest resurgence in cases has shown the government is willing to bring back economic support for people who might lose their jobs due to lockdown. Ardern said the only way the government can make a difference to house prices in New Zealand is to increase supply. "This is a massively damaging economic event, however it's also an opportunity. As a part of our Covid response and recovery we've said we want another 8000 public houses. "We also want to use, and KiwiBuild is still in operation, we want to use that as a tool to make sure private development is still happening so we don't see the collapse of our residential housing market. Ardern said Labour will be releasing five policies this week.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425397/new-zealand-first-cautious-about-plan-to-install-hundreds-more-cameras-on-fishing-boats|2020-09-07|New Zealand First could still put the brakes on the extension of cameras on more fishing boats, depending on the outcome of the election. Photo: 123RF The government on Friday revealed plans to put cameras on board 345 vessels, costing $40 million to $60m. The cameras are intended to monitor fishing crews who have been accused by environmentalists of hiding illegal by-catch - that is, fish for which they do not hold quota getting caught in their nets. A second accusation is that fishing firms have in the past covered up the accidental death of marine mammals or seabirds. Fishing companies have repeatedly denied these charges but have since come round to accepting cameras anyway. Some cameras have already been installed on board trawlers as a trial run. New Zealand First has long resisted cameras, but has now agreed with Labour to extend their use. But the party's fishing spokesperson, Shane Jones, said he would be watching the process closely to make sure it did not handicap the economy. It was important to keep earnings by the primary sector strong, for the benefit of New Zealand as a whole, he said. "The installation of cameras on fishing boats needs to driven by a robust appraisal ... and careful analysis of what is the business case (for them)," he said. "In this post Covid environment it is incredibly important that revenue is delivered with gusto. "Revenue represents jobs, revenue represents the ability of the community through the government to service the borrowings we have racked up to deal with the Covid disruption." Jones said he was an economic realist and added even if cameras did go ahead, they should not be imposed on small fishing firms. "People harvesting spat off 90 Mile beach, or catching mullet, or flounder in northern harbours in small, tinny boats - do they represent such a threat that they need to be burdened with $20 - $30,000 of camera costs? "You don't know that - that is why a business case is needed." Jones's comments came as analysis of the fine print in the government statement suggested cameras on fishing boats were still a work in progress, and a lot more work was needed before cameras were a reality. In his statement, Fisheries Minister Stuart Nash said the business case for the cameras was being put together by officials and would still need Cabinet sign-off. He added a big problem was the huge cost of storing and analysing mountains of data produced by the cameras. There would be further analysis and more submissions from the public before the scheme was implemented. Despite these problems, the fishing industry has become quite philosophical about cameras on boats. It has earlier argued cameras filming people at work intruded on their privacy and were not imposed on other workers such as farmers, teachers or lawyers. But Jeremy Helson of Seafood New Zealand now said everyone now wanted these cameras in principle - the trouble was, there were many technical details to iron out. One issue was, who would own - and be able to view - the footage taken by the cameras. Helson's answer was government officials, not the public. "Given they are government cameras, the ownership [of the footage] would sit with MPI [Ministry for Primary Industries], and they would they view it as they saw fit to meet their management and compliance objectives - we have no issue with that. "We think people's privacy is an issue that will need to be navigated - these are people's private workplaces, so that everyone needs ... to make sure that appropriate safeguards are put in place." Most non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have long argued that cameras on boats are a law enforcement mechanism and so should be made available to the public. But many now accept some sort of compromise on public access is justifiable to safeguard fishing crew's personal privacy.

Dr Shane Reti. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Currently, it is only compulsory for testing on day 12, and the government has said that is enough to keep the public safe. If a test was refused at this time, people would be forced to spend another 14 days in isolation. However, National's health spokesperson Dr Shane Reti said this wasn't good enough. "If you wait to day 12, you have all those days in managed isolation where you're mixing with cohorts, giving it to other people, giving it to staff," he said. "We should just make it compulsory at day three like we do at day 12. If the test is refused at day three, then you become a presumed positive and you move through to quarantine. " The proposal is one of five released by the National Party, which also included requiring people who test negative for Covid be notified within a 48 hours period so they can get back to work sooner. Reti said he was aware of people waiting up to eight days to get a negative test result. He also proposed re-testing every positive case within 24 hours to get better genomic data.

James Shaw presented Judith Collins with a gift she has made the most of. Photo: RNZ "It didn't work out well." James Shaw's words will probably go down as the understatement of the year after his disastrous decision to fund a private school nearly $12 million of taxpayer money. Shaw issued a media release last week to announce the decision to fund the development of the Taranaki Green School. It sounded like good news, and Shaw clearly thought it was a big win. The Green Party co-leader said the $11.7 million would allow the school to expand its roll from 120 students to 250, secure 200 construction jobs and contribute $43 million a year to Taranaki's economy. It was one of the "shovel ready" projects to be funded through the $3 billion Covid-19 Recovery Fund. What he hadn't considered, or perhaps hadn't remembered, was his party's fundamental policy that private schools should not be publicly funded. Shaw initially defended his decision, saying the money was for a construction project, but the storm that brewed over the weekend forced him to admit on Tuesday he had made "an error of judgement" and issue an apology to everyone he could possibly apologise to. They included his MPs, former MPs, teacher unions and parents. During the uproar, which gained extraordinary publicity, the "construction project" justification was totally eclipsed. It became a very emotive matter of the government giving money to a private school charging fees of up to $40,000 a year while state schools in the region suffered severe under-funding. One former MP, Catherine Delahunty, stated a concern that may have been shared by others: "I think James, as a minister, has become isolated from the party to some degree, in the sense of his instincts didn't tell him that this was never going to fly with the Green Party." The acting principal of New Plymouth's Marfell Community School, Keally Warren, wrote a scathing letter to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern telling her the grant was "totally unacceptable, elitist and completely inequitable". It was a gift for the opposition. National's leader Judith Collins went to New Plymouth to announce a policy that would allocate nearly $5 billion to repairing and renewing schools and classrooms across the country over the next 10 years. That helped fuel the fire that was roasting Shaw. Collins said he should resign, which Shaw didn't feel was necessary. Late on Wednesday a bad situation became worse when Newshub reported an email from Shaw's office to his fellow ministers which said he wasn't going to sign off on at least 44 other shovel-ready projects unless the grant to the Green School was included. It would be interesting to know how Newshub got hold of the email. Collins accused him of "holding the rest of the government basically to ransom" and suggested to RNZ the delay could have cost hundreds of jobs. Shaw denied there had been any hold up and said the email was sent because he had concerns about some of the other projects. The Green School's chief executive, Chris Edwards, said the application had been for the money to be split - 25 percent as a grant and the rest in a series of loans. He emphasised that it wasn't education money, and said if the school didn't get it not a cent would come back to the public sector or Taranaki. Efforts are under way to turn the funding for the Green School in Taranaki into a grant and a series of loans. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin Shaw said he thought the best solution would be for the money to become a loan, and at the end of the week negotiations were under way. Finance Minister Grant Robertson had earlier said there was no question of pulling the funding because it had been granted in good faith. As RNZ's political editor Jane Patterson pointed out, Shaw's fellow ministers didn't rush to help him out. Education Minister Chris Hipkins said funding the Green School wasn't something he would have prioritised. Labour wanted to stay well clear of it. Trevor Mallard Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Collins, meanwhile, had some problems of her own. Speaker Trevor Mallard ordered National to withdraw a "misleading" advert which purported to show a statement on a ministerial letterhead and carried the party leader's name as the authoriser. Collins said she hadn't known anything about it. The party had put it up without telling her. "I didn't even know about the ad, which I was really quite annoyed about," she said. "The use of my name was unacceptable." On Thursday Collins continued her social policy rollout, promising services worth $3000 for new parents. It would be means tested. The funding would not be a direct payment but would allow parents to access services during the first 1000 days of their child's life such as post-birth screening, additional paid parental leave, specialist support and GP home visits. National has costed the policy at $200 million a year. "This new funding, allocated per child rather than directly to services, will mean that parental demand will determine which services receive how much of the additional money," Collins said. At the same time, National would means test the $60 a week Best Start payment for new parents introduced by the government. Parliament adjourned on Wednesday and will be dissolved on Sunday so the 17 October election can take place. The prime minister delayed the date from 19 September because of the Covid-19 outbreak and Parliament sat for an extra three weeks. It was a feeble session with far fewer MPs than usual because of Auckland's restrictions. Collins' questioning of Ardern was more irritating than incisive and MPs were glad to get it over with. "Zombie Parliament stumbles to a close with little to inspire," said Stuff's headline, and it was about right. *Peter Wilson is a life member of Parliament's press gallery, 22 years as NZPA's political editor and seven as parliamentary bureau chief for NZ Newswire.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425240/covid-19-visa-extensions-allow-visitors-migrants-more-time|2020-09-04|Visitors and temporary migrants stuck in New Zealand due to Covid-19 will have their visas extended to give them more time to organise flights home. Photo: 2020 Getty Images Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi has announced those already in the country with vistor visas due to expire before the end of October will have their visa automatically extended for five months. Temporary migrants unable to leave due to international travel restrictions will receive a new two-month Covid-19 short-term visa, which will kick in when their current visa expires, he says. There are roughly 19,000 people in New Zealand who hold visitor visas that will be eligible for the automatic five-month extension. Faafoi says about 268,000 foreign nationals have departed New Zealand since March 2020. He says the changes are specifically to help those people already in New Zealand with no immediate option to return home. "Temporary migrants need to have a valid visa to remain lawfully in New Zealand, otherwise they are required to leave the country. "However, we know that international travel restrictions due to Covid-19 have affected many people's ability to leave New Zealand before their visas expire," Faafoi says. "These changes will provide visitors and other temporary migrants stranded in New Zealand with more certainty and time to organise travel arrangements home. The new two-month Covid-19 short-term visitor visa will help people reaching the end of their visitor, work, student or partnership visa who may not meet the criteria for another visa, and need time to arrange travel home, Faafoi says. "To be eligible for the Covid-19 short-term visitor visa, Immigration New Zealand must be satisfied visitor visa holders are genuinely unable to leave New Zealand as a result of Covid-19, they are intending to depart, and they meet normal good character requirements. "However, temporary migrants who choose to apply for the Covid-19 short-term visitor visa will not need to meet other usual visitor visa requirements, such as demonstrating that they have enough money to support their stay, having existing onward travel arrangements, or that they've met time limits for their stay in New Zealand," he says.

Willis said the Ministry of Education was projecting an additional 910 students within the Waimea area by 2028. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Education spokesperson Nicola Willis said today it would proceed with a new Berryfields Primary School in the Richmond West Housing development. It would be part of National's $4.8 billion education infrastructure package announced on Monday. A spokesperson for minister of education Chris Hipkins said the government has already secured a site for a new primary school in Richmond West, but details remained commercially sensitive. Consultation on addressing roll growth was also underway with the community, which included an option for a new school on a new site. Willis said the Ministry of Education was projecting an additional 910 students within the Waimea area by 2028. "National is committing to a new Berryfields School but the consultation process is important to determine whether it should be a full primary or a contributing primary school. "There is also a discussion on which National is open minded about whether some Waimea Schools may keep their Year 7 and 8 students to relieve pressure on Waimea Intermediate."
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425200/a-political-battle-is-brewing-in-northland-with-three-candidates-facing-off|2020-09-04|Analysis - There's a battle brewing in the seat of Northland, with the future of one party potentially riding on the result. NZ First's Shane Jones, Labour's Willow-Jean Prime and National's Matt King are facing off in the Northland electorate. Photo: RNZ / Labour Party / RNZ The colourful New Zealand First MP Shane Jones is in a fight for his political life, with Labour unwilling to lend a hand. He's up against Labour's Willow-Jean Prime, and the incumbent MP Matt King - both of whom are ahead of Jones in recent polling. Before Auckland re-entered lockdown RNZ political reporter Jo Moir travelled north to meet with the contenders. Northland's not only a potential political lifeline for Shane Jones, but his party, that's been languishing below the crucial 5 percent party vote threshold. He has a battle on his hands, and wants to remind voters of the money poured into the region under the coalition. Jones says National voters don't realise how wasted their vote is if they continue to give it to the blue team under current conditions - in particular in view of Jacinda Ardern's trajectory. Labour, he says, will reward the constituencies that propel it into power if left to govern alone - and Northland won't be one of them. "The Labour Party and their brilliant communicator Jacinda Ardern have a very lucid and crystal clear strategy to govern by themselves. "For the Labour Party taking the turtle strategy is rational - maintain a steady and predictable turtle approach - my job as a New Zealand First politician is to flip the turtle over,'' Jones says. The incumbent in Northland is Matt King. He won the seat back for National in 2017 against Winston Peters. The New Zealand First leader secured the seat in a by-election in 2015 after then-Labour leader Andrew Little did a deal and told candidate Willow-Jean Prime to pull back on campaigning. Prime picked up a decent chunk of the vote in 2017, ruining Peters' chances of holding onto the seat, and ensuring it returned to its National roots. She's in the race again this time round and Labour leader Jacinda Ardern says a deal isn't happening. Prime says telling people who they should vote for is "offensive''. King is surprised but pleased Prime is contesting the election on both counts. "I felt that they were going to do a deal. They did a deal in 2015, it was all under the table, but it was definitely a deal. "I thought that's what they'd do again - I'm quite surprised - Willow-Jean is running a two tick campaign and I'm quite happy with that,'' he says. King also sympathises for those in the electorate who feel like they're not getting their fair share. "I think Northlanders generally feel that they have been a forgotten territory by successive governments and to a degree I agree with that.'' And while Northlanders rejected National's ten bridge promise in 2015, King says they're not fooled by New Zealand First's pork-barrelling. Prime says the odds are stacked against the North. "We are unfortunately in Northland, and in communities like this, over-represented in the negative statistics in terms of unemployment, welfare dependency, health outcomes, lower educational achievement. I could go on - suicide, incarceration, recidivism - it's a bleak picture,'' Prime says. One aspect that has changed the race for the North is Jones' less bombastic rhetoric. It's intentional after his mother and wife offered the following advice. "Don't wander around using words that the average voter has no idea what you're talking about, because half the time you sound as if you don't know what you're talking about. "So yes, I've been given that unwanted advice and hopefully it's evident that I'm starting to follow it,'' Jones says. King says a more subdued Jones makes his job more difficult, because voters respond better to it. The relationship between the three is incredibly warm. Prime and Jones often share cars to announcements and airports. On the day RNZ was interviewing King in Kerikeri he received a text message from Prime asking nicely for details for a candidates' meeting that night, which King happily passed on. Northland is home for all of them and Prime says ultimately she thinks they all care more about the people than the politics. Easy for Prime to say perhaps, given she's in the most comfortable position with a winnable list spot on current polling. Up against a man who already holds the seat but with a party vote that's in decline, and one clinging on to Parliament by his fingernails. There are two types of Northland and the three main candidates vying for the job of electorate MP come 17 October all have their own experiences of both. Matt King is a farmer who lives in Okaihau in South Hokianga. But in an earlier life he was a policeman in the North - his son now is too. King saw the destruction things like methamphetamine, alcohol and domestic violence did to communities in places like Kaikohe. He's seen how both sides live and worked amongst it. Then there's Ngpuhi's Willow-Jean Prime. She grew up in Moerewa and chose to stay living there despite the reputation that took hold when local industry closed, drug addiction and family violence rose and the town became a place nobody ever stopped in. Prime is one of the lucky ones who has done good - making it onto the Far North District Council before becoming a list MP for Labour at the 2017 election. Her children go to the local school, she spends her time in the town working with community hubs trying to get locals clean and into work and then when Parliament is sitting she lives a different life in Wellington. She takes RNZ to the one and only caf in Moerewa for what is a darn good coffee, but she says despite many trying, the store has had multiple owners over the years as the coffee culture doesn't exist for the people of Moerewa and the out-of-towners don't want to stop. It's a far cry from the latte-sipping at Parliament. Then there's the new guy in the race - Shane Jones. He's Te Aupuri, Ngi Takoto. Jones is also local and if he can win the seat then the party has a lifeline, and it would almost certainly seal the deal for Jones as the future leader of the party. He lives in Kerikeri too, but grew up in Awanui. His family lives in Mangonui and he himself has land there. Jones is the Mori who went to Harvard University, is one of the most eloquent English speakers Parliament has ever seen, but is just as happy on the marae speaking and translating te reo Mori. He wears a suit more often these days but is more comfortable in gumboots. Kerikeri is fast becoming a Tauranga - the town is constantly growing but rather than it being Northlanders returning home, it's Aucklanders moving north for the quieter life away from the hustle and bustle. While that brings money to the region, it also brings expectations. The wealth divide is stark and while the ratepayer base in Kerikeri and surrounding areas can afford to pay for a new wastewater treatment plant (albeit a very delayed one) - Moerewa residents have just recently, for the third time in a decade, been left to clean up their homes in the wake of flooding. And it wasn't just the river water that poured through their homes, locals were literally sweeping out their own sewage water too. This is just one of the many differences at play. Transport is an issue too. Household cars are few and far between and while a Four Square services the Moerewa area, the more competitively priced larger supermarket chains are in Kerikeri and Kaikohe - both a 20 minute drive away. There's no public transport to help either. Access to affordable food is just one of many factors that ensure poverty-stricken towns remain exactly that - it's a plague that affects many parts of the country. But despite the town being up against inequity, there are dozens of people trying to do their bit to change it. And in many cases they're who you'd least expect. There's recovered methamphetamine addicts running addiction support programmes on the smell of an oily rag. They're hosting community meetings on issues like recent abortion reform, to make sure people are getting correct information rather than the misinformation most fall victim to on social media. Finding somewhere to hold meetings isn't always simple and Prime was left chuckling on the street when the church was offered up as a suggested location for a talk about abortion, because it would fit more people. Then there's Jessie-Lee Reihana - herself three years clean from drugs, and a single mother of three. She opened Fight Fitness Moerewa with her business partner a few months ago but nothing about what they do fits a traditional business model. The gym is about body fit mind and is full of boxing bags and a few other bits of equipment including large tyres and ropes. It's been set up to give recovering addicts something to do to keep their mind from the obvious thing it wants. But it's also to keep the youth off the streets and keep kuia and kaumtua fit and healthy. Half of the classes are designed around the shifts at the local AFFCO, one of the few places people can get work. Some pay in biscuits, some pay a small amount, some don't pay at all. And sausage sizzles are forced to go a long way. But nearby in Paihia, real estate agent Ross Robertson, says his town is suffering too. "Paihia's had a huge hit with Covid, because we're largely tourism orientated. "So you're talking about motels that lost all their business overnight,'' he says. Paihia motel owner Julie Barlow says her business was closed for the two month duration of lockdown. "Trying to run a motel you've got $6000 of recurring expenses - you've still got to pay your rates, still got to pay your power, still got to have your TVs going so you can't just shut that off. "Starting with weekends we're now getting a few people, but during the week it's very rare,'' she says. With Covid-19 part of the landscape for some time yet, business owners in the North say they just want some certainty about ongoing support. Northland isn't alone on that, ensuring this election will be won and lost on political party's plans for the new normal.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425187/covid-19-cabinet-to-decide-on-alert-level-settings-today|2020-09-04|The country will find out today whether or not the government will ease alert level restrictions next week. Parliament and Beehive Photo: RNZ Cabinet Ministers are meeting today to review the country's alert levels, which are set to expire this Sunday. Hospitality New Zealand Otago branch president Mark Scully, who operates the Speights Ale House, said level 2 had not been great for business. "We have had a lot of people, particularly older people who have cancelled bookings just for the fact they are nervous we are in level 2, so it sort of affects your business in several different ways," he said. He is holding out for good news this afternoon that the South Island can move to level 1. "I think everyone's initial reaction is that it should be one, because we haven't had a community case here for so long," he said. "I understand why there has been some caution but I think at this stage we should perhaps be getting to level 1 definitely." Just one new case of Covid-19 was reported in the community yesterday, which was linked to the Auckland cluster. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has warned that may not guarantee a lowering of alert levels. "We have been at this level only for a very short period of time, we are still in this earlyish stage of seeing that impact on the cluster and so these are all things Cabinet will consider," she said. ACT leader David Seymour said areas outside of Auckland should be at level 1 and Auckland should see some restrictions eased. "It seems unfair to place restrictions on people so far away, where the risk is so remote and yet the costs are enormous," he said. Auckland University Professor Shaun Hendy, whose modelling has guided the government's response, said it was too early to tell the true impact of the current alert level. "It would wise to figure out how well the current settings have worked before we change them," he said. Prof Hendy said it would be best to keep the whole country at level 2. "The risks now are that Aucklanders are travelling again [out] of an outbreak in another part of the country and if we were at level 1 then that outbreak can grow very rapidly, whereas in level 2 there is a chance it won't take hold at all, or it will grow slowly so we will be better able to contain it."

Photo: RNZ A leaked video shows Shaw telling party members he got the okay from Hipkins in a conversation they had before the controversial bid was signed off. Shaw's been in damage control since infuriating party supporters, schools and unions with his strong advocacy for the nearly $12 million application for the private school. The expansion project was approved by a group of wider ministers under a $3 billion infrastructure fund - they say Shaw should take full responsibility as the sole advocate for the bid. That advocacy extended to threatening to block at least 44 projects, earmarked for $600m of funding, unless it was given the green light. While Hipkins had no involvement in the ministerial approval, in the video, Shaw says he gave him "verbal sign-off". Hipkins told reporters today he did talk to Shaw about the Green School bid and told him "it was not a priority for education funding... but of course I'm not one of the ministers involved in decisions around the 'shovel ready' projects, so it was not a matter for me to sign off, or otherwise". When asked if he had provided "verbal sign-off", Hipkins said "no, I think that would mischaracterise the conversation". No support either from New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, who said Shaw had once again demonstrated his lack of experience. The video would not help Shaw, Peters said. "Why on earth is he potting the Labour Party again? "When you make a botch up - accept it yourself, stop blaming everybody else." National's Judith Collins said someone was "not telling the truth so they need to actually decide and let us know". ACT leader David Seymour said if Hipkins did agree to the funding that would be a "real disappointment". "But if he truly disagreed he should pull the funding as a senior member of Cabinet; he should be using his influence to do the right thing." "Perhaps Mr Hipkins can't remember because he's distracted being too many things to too many people. "When you're education minister, health minister, state services minister and Leader of the House it's easy to see how you'd drop the ball." Shaw declined an interview today, but a spokesperson said he "stands by his commentary on the members call and continues to feel supported by caucus and the membership".

Rear Commodore of the Ocean Cruising Club Guy Chester. Photo: Supplied. The Ocean Cruising Club has been lobbying the government since April, but under Covid-19 restrictions, cyclone refuge is not considered a reason for border exemption. Guy Chester, a Roving Rear Commodore with the club, has been fighting to get the hundreds of people a safe place to spend the season. He said in June, they were told there would be a border exemption process for humanitarian and compelling reasons. But last week they discovered cyclone refuge was not included. Chester said they felt betrayed by the government. "We've run out of time," he said The club had been working with the New Zealand health processes, talking to officers, said Chester. "We've now got the situation where we have just been told that cyclone refuge is not a compelling reason and exemptions will not be granted, in which case, it's now vital." The cyclone season starts on 1 November, but with most boats between 2 to 6 weeks away from somewhere safe, it had now reached crisis point, he said. "I'm distressed, I've been working on behalf of all the yachts and I'm feeling a huge responsibility for people's safety, and we haven't got a solution. "I'm feeling betrayed because I was telling people 'look it's coming, just don't panic yet, we've got a letter saying it's going to be okay, they are just trying to get everything in line'," he said. Chester said the yachties understand New Zealand is trying to protect itself from the virus, and the club had developed and isolation plan for various berths in the north. But he said he was in dismay the Government said there was a process coming, when in actual fact, that process did not apply to them. "We have families with young kids, and we have people panicking that they are going to be stuck in a cyclone prone zone. "People just don't know what to do." Chester said, none of this was by choice, when these people set out, they didn't know there was going to be a global pandemic. He said there are now hundreds of people, desperate and out of safe options. Both the Ministry and the Minster of Health have been approached for comment.

The comments contradict Hipkins who's repeatedly stated he did not back the proposal. RNZ has been sent footage of the Friday night Zoom meeting in which Shaw sought to assuage party members who were furious at his advocacy for a nearly $12 million funding package for the private Green School in Taranaki. In the video clip, Shaw tells members that Hipkins "wasn't intimately involved in the decision" but gave it tacit approval in a conversation. "He did, sort of, give at least a verbal sign-off to the project," Shaw said. "He did say that - assuming everything else being equal - as long as the funding partner is the [New Plymouth District] Council, which it is, that he was okay with it." Hipkins turned down RNZ's request for an interview, but, in a statement, said he made clear to Shaw the funding would not come out of the education sector's budget. He acknowledged he also told the Greens co-leader: "Apart from that, do what you have to do." Last week, Hipkins told reporters the school project was "not necessarily a project that [he] would've prioritised". On Tuesday this week, he told Parliament he had a conversation with Shaw about the application at the end of July. "I gave him feedback that from an educational portfolio perspective the school would not be a priority for investment," Hipkins said. Hipkins had no formal role or responsibility for signing off on the $11.7m funding package as it comes out of the government's $3 billion war-chest for "shovel-ready projects", overseen by other ministers. On the Green Party call, Shaw told members his support for the school funding was coloured by the NZ Upgrade announcement in January in which billions of dollars were committed to new roading projects. There has been an ideological battle between the governing parties in areas like transport, with Shaw making it clear back in January he thought the mix too heavily favoured roading, at the expense of other more Green initiatives. The extent of his advocacy for the Green School was revealed this week: Shaw refused to sign off on at least 44 projects earmarked for $600 million of funding, unless it was given the green light. Shaw has since apologised profusely to a range of people and organisations. Officials and the school are working on what will likely end up as a government loan. In a statement, New Plymouth District Council chief executive Craig Stevenson said the council was not a funding partner for the Green School project and was not involved in the funding application. He said that with any development in the district, its role was that of regulator for building and resource consents. "In terms of the letter of support, the mayor's role is to advocate for investment from central government and that's why he writes dozens of letters of support for multiple groups, businesses and organisations to ensure Taranaki gets its fair share of New Zealand's funding pie."

Port Tarakohe. Photo: Supplied / Tasman District Council The loan via the Provincial Growth Fund was announced in Richmond today by the Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. He said it would help open up access to commercial marina berths, create more working wharf space, a new food grade wharf area and harbour master building, as well as create potential hundreds of jobs. Peters was to have made the announcement a few weeks ago, but his electioneering road-trip had to be re-scheduled because of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. He was glad to have made it today, and was grateful for the official welcome by local iwi, led by archdeacon Harvey Whakaruru. "Politicians have a habit of shaking your hand before an election, and your confidence after it." Peters said the new port was also expected to create a greater demand for support services, such as boat maintenance and marine engineering. Last year the Tasman District Council was awarded a quarter of a million dollars from the Provincial Growth Fund to investigate ways the council-owned port could grow in order to service an expanding aquaculture industry. The government investment announced today was designed to boost that made by the council and industry. Marine Farming Association president Jonathan Large said the industry was already well into a $100m investment plan through consents, farm infrastructure and vessels. Photo: RNZ / Tracy Neal He said the support from government gave the industry the confidence it needed to continue operating from Golden Bay. It comes at a time that Golden Bay residents are pushing for tighter controls on the marine farming industry. Six locals have formed a group called the Marine Farming Impact Group, to raise awareness of the problems that marine farming was creating, as well as encouraging the industry to carry out their work responsibly for both residents and the environment. Peters said up to 47,000 tonnes of mussels were expected to be harvested annually once all farms in Golden Bay were operating and in full production. He said the upgrade would separate commercial and recreation activities at Tarakohe, which was also used by yachts and powerboats. "It's not all for commercial gain as a replacement recreational marina will also be built." Photo: RNZ / Tracy Neal The project would also improve Golden Bay's resilience in the event of a natural disaster or Civil Defence emergency. Large said in September last year the government announced its aquaculture strategy which included a growth target of $3 billion in annual sales by 2035. "In post Covid times with the focus on first stabilising then increasing GDP, the government has again shown its confidence in the industry by bringing forward that target to 2030." He said New Zealand aquaculture had some of the world's best seafood, from Michelin star cuisine to designer petfood for labradors with bad hips. The Port Tarakohe redevelopment was expected to take two years to complete.

File image. Photo: 123rf Expecting parents would be offered a free GP screening visit and those deemed to have higher needs - up to 10 percent - would be allocated up to $6000. The funding would not be a direct payment, but would allow parents to seek help from eligible services during the first 1000 days of their child's life. The Best Start payment of $60 a week introduced by the Labour-led government this term would be made means-tested. National leader Judith Collins announced the promise on Thursday afternoon while unveiling the party's seven-part plan to support parents and children. The party has costed the policy at nearly $200 million a year. In a statement, social investment spokesperson Louise Upston said the payment would empower parents. "National's bold plan would give parents commissioning power over the support they need, recognising the fact that a mother with her third child may need different services than a mother experiencing her first pregnancy. "This new funding, allocated per child rather than directly to services, will mean that parental demand will determine which services receive how much of the additional money." The funding could be used on extended post-natal stay, additional parental leave or more early childhood education hours. It could also be spent on a range of services including: specialist support, GP home visits, and membership in parenting groups such as SPACE, Play Centre and Te Khanga Reo. Organisations funded by the government such as Plunket would keep their exisiting baseline funding. National would allow both parents to claim paid leave at the same time and would guarantee all new mothers a three-day-stay in their postnatal facility. It would also set up a National Centre for Child Development and issue an electronic "child passport" to keep track of babies' milestones. Upston said parents would determine what the funding was spent on. Louise Upston. Photo: RNZ / Emile Donovan "So, it might be on specialist breastfeeding care for example, it might be on a longer post-natal stay, it might be as a first time parent without much support they want more actual education around mother craft skills - you name it. "Anything that can demonstrate support and improvement for that child's development in that family," Upston said. The current public health system was not serving new mothers, she said. "If you look at the needs of many mums yes, we have a universal system now and it's a good system, but there are needs over and above and the evidence tells us investment in the first 1000 days is critical," Upston said.

TOP leader Geoff Simmons, right, at the party's cannabis bill event. Photo: Supplied The referendum asks voters if they support the proposed bill, which would make recreational cannabis legal to consume in some circumstances. If the majority of New Zealanders support the proposed legislation, the incoming government can introduce it to Parliament, where it would later proceed to the select committee stage. TOP is promising to allow local councils to set and enforce Local Area Policies, so the visibility of recreational cannabis is controlled if elected in October. The party launched its cannabis and drug reform policy in Wellington this morning at a pop-up cannabis cafe in the central city. "Wellington, known for its more liberal culture, might want an Amsterdam-style caf culture, whereas more conservative communities may want to keep cannabis dispensaries at a distance for now," TOP leader Geoff Simmons said. "It's important that Kiwis feel that this legislation empowers them to make the right choice for their area, rather than an all-encompassing blanket approach." The party is also promising to use revenue from the cannabis market to fund social services and expand the drug courts nationwide.

Greens co-leader James Shaw. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Shaw has been hit by a wave of controversy, after he championed nearly $12m in funding for the private Green School. The school was only included in ministers' list of 'shovel ready' projects after Shaw refused to back other projects without it. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said when the email was sent on 7 August, Shaw needed to sign off on the final list. "We had already announced a large number of projects, we were at the end of the process, there was a bit of coming and going with projects so obviously that email said what it said, but we had announced a large number of projects before that point," he said. As of the 6 August, 118 shovel ready projects had already been announced, totalling $1.8 billion in government funding. But, by the 28 August a list of 162 projects had been announced, meaning that at least 44 projects were awaiting government approval when Shaw drew a line in the sand with his email. Yesterday, Shaw apologised for an 'error of judgement' over the funding. But National's Judith Collins is accusing Shaw of political posturing during a crisis. "James Shaw was willing to play politics with his own government at a time when contractors, councils and workers were crying out for work, I actually think he's put at risk people's jobs," she said. Collins has said she thinks Shaw should resign over the mistake. "It's not just that he advocated for a particular Green School that doesn't even have education registration to be a school, but that he's actually held up all these projects on the basis that he was holding the rest of the government basically to ransom," Collins said.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425075/james-shaw-battles-to-restore-his-credibility|2020-09-02|Power Play - This time last election James Shaw captained the Green Party through the stormy waters after Metiria Turei's dramatic resignation - now he's in danger of capsizing the ship himself. Green Party co-leader James Shaw. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone He's battling to restore his political credibility and trust with the party base after being chief cheerleader for a private school project that's enraged Green supporters, school principals and unions. Shaw has prostrated himself and offered an apology to a list of people too long to name but remains in a precarious position just over six weeks out from the general election. The complete contradiction of the party's own policy has prompted a mutiny among some party supporters, exacerbated by stark comparisons of nearly $12 million to upgrade and expand the Green School while many public schools grapple with decrepit, leaky and mouldy classrooms and buildings. That outrage spread further to members of the public who couldn't give a hoot about Green party policy but were alarmed at such largesse shown towards a private school. It's also opened up a seam of distrust from the more traditional side of the party, that Shaw is too businesslike, too centrist, too far removed from core Green principles. These are accusations from within he's defended before, but many believe his strong backing of the Green School shows he's disconnected from those key beliefs, and has shown an incredible lack of political judgement. That extended to threatening to withhold sign off for other projects in the infrastructure package if the Green School wasn't included - that was dismissed as an unavoidable part of running a coalition by Labour. The Green School is located in the Taranaki district. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin But will it hurt the Greens in the polls? The problem is they've been teetering around the 5 percent mark in political polling; that's the crucial mark parties have to reach to get into Parliament if they don't have an electorate seat. Growing its support therefore, not decimating it, is even more important. Timing is everything and the six weeks left does give Shaw and co-leader Marama Davidson a window of opportunity if they can shut this down and soothe ruffled feathers. This term of Parliament winding up today will help, by removing the daily platform for political opponents wanting to keep the story alive. While Shaw has floundered this week his ministerial colleagues have sat back and watched; no-one has been willing to throw him a lifeline. Senior Labour Party ministers made it very clear Shaw was the minister who backed the project and the responsibility was his alone; they could see the proverbial was about to start flying and wanted to make sure they were all well out of the way. The Greens might be a Labour ally but it's every party for itself as they all gear up to resume campaigning and if there are any votes lost from the Greens, Labour is the most likely beneficiary. Or disillusioned Green supporters just may not vote. This is an incredibly volatile political environment and Labour will be out for every vote it can get. Shaw's management of this situation has made it worse. The Green School told RNZ the original plan was for a loan and the whole $11.7m was never going to be a straight grant. That tallies with other political sources who say officials were so opposed to giving the school a taxpayer handout a loan was seen as the only option to progress the application. But the way Shaw presented it, it was as a grant; in his August announcement he talked about "government funding for a school expansion project," of $11.7m from the Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund, and then again during his apology speech. "My personal view is that the best way to do this is that support for the Green School to come in the form of a loan, rather than a grant. That would ensure the money is paid back in full." That has just made the whole situation worse... a loan would have been bad enough but it was the prospect of a straight government handout to a private school that caused such outrage. A loan is in fact where this is all likely to end up, with the school and officials now working on a solution that keeps faith with what ministers agreed to, while minimising political damage. Everyone is asking why Shaw was so amped about for the Green School project but there is no evidence at all of any personal or political connections. More likely he was motivated by seeing hundreds of millions of dollars going out the door for roads and other "non-Green" infrastructure and saw the Green School as a way of stamping his party's mark. Whether or not that blinded him to the political risks of that particular project is a question only he can answer, but regardless it's a massive own goal. This remains a real problem for Shaw and his party. It's a story that's caught the attention of not only die hard supporters - but also the wider public. The coming week will be crucial. The Opposition has already called for his resignation but this is a blunder of political misjudgement, not ministerial misconduct so that would only be forced if the Greens make it clear to Shaw they no longer have confidence in him as leader and as their ministerial representation. He is not at that point but this is certainly not the way the Greens would have wanted to go into their 2020 campaign, with potentially a seat in the next government at stake.

Green School New Zealand. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin This is news to the Green Party co-leader James Shaw who says he knew nothing about it before granting the school nearly $12 million. He has since apologised, describing the move as an error of judgement. He also said the money would most likely now be in the form of a loan rather than grant. Green Party co-leader James Shaw. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone The Green School is owned by Michael and Rachel Perrett, who are co-founders of the HRV ventilation company, which they sold in 2010. In November last year, they began lobbying the New Plymouth District Council for a district plan change to allow "residential activities associated with the school" in an area currently zoned as Rural Production. In April, the council approved the sale of several paper roads on the site for $165,000 plus $10,000 in fees. Councillors were told the sale would help the school expand its roll to 500, but there was no mention of an eco-village or a residential development. Kaitake community board chair Doug Hislop said there had been whispers about housing at the site for some time, but nothing official. "My understanding is that they've always intended to have a settlement up there for the parents I think of their international students. That's they way I understand it." Diagram showing paper roads in Taranaki. Photo: Supplied He said the paper roads - which were for a settlement designed to reward soldiers and militia who fought in the Taranaki wars - would have been an impediment to any subdivision. "Under the situation where there were paper roads and so on, you wouldn't be able put a house in the middle of where there was a paper road, if the paper road was still there." But with the roads gone, normal planning rules apply, Hislop said. "And what happens to it subsequently is there are rules in the district plan where if the owner so wishes they can apply to the council through the district plan for a consent to build on it or create lifestyle blocks or whatever it is they want to do." New Plymouth Mayor Neil Holdom declined an interview. He said his discussions with Green Party co-leader James Shaw focused only on shovel-ready projects. The eco-village was not raised. The Green School also declined an interview. Artist impression of the Taranaki Green School's building pods. Photo: Supplied In a statement, it said it had always been open about plans for the eco-village and they were not required as part of the Shovel Ready funding application. "The plans refer to an eco-village housing area that has been in the public domain since the inception of Green School and shared openly with anyone interested in the project. It is a matter of public record." But there is no public record of the eco-village. It is not mentioned on the Green School website, in council documents or in previous media coverage about the school. The school later clarified that the village has been mentioned in verbal briefings to people who have expressed an interest. It said the development was in its early stages and would help relieve demands on rental property in Taranaki. "There is a mix of housing available for school parents and the open market whereby they will be available for anyone looking to move into the area. "These sustainable homes, of which there will be approximately 20, will be physically located on the other side of the road and away from the Green School campus." A map showing the land owned by Green School in Taranaki. Photo: Supplied Harcourts Taranaki general manager Graham Richards was excited at the prospect of more homes becoming available in the area. "Very, very much so. It's a very popular location. Obviously the Green School is a huge attraction, but around akura and the surrounding district there's a huge demand for property." Richards said they would fetch a pretty penny if they ever came up for sale. "A small lifestyle block in the country generally in that area, it's pretty hard to get in there for less than $600,000 and I guess you can spend up to $2 million depending on the size of the block and the actual quality of the home and improvements." James Shaw also turned down an interview. Asked via email, if he thought it was appropriate that public money used for the Green School's expansion could play a role in helping to make a housing development there a success? He said he didn't know anything about the eco-village. Shaw said neither the New Plymouth mayor or owners of the school had mentioned the development to him. Public submissions on the district plan closed last month. Council officers are now preparing reports before hearings will be scheduled.

Auckland's main street has gained a bit more life since level 3 restrictions were removed on Sunday night, but a move to level 1 is not yet in sight. Photo: RNZ / Amy Williams Cabinet Ministers will meet on Friday to review the alert level settings, which are set to expire on Sunday. Auckland is at alert level 2.5, which means there are tighter restrictions on mass gatherings. The same rules do not apply for the rest of the country, which is at alert level 2. At a Health Select Committee meeting this morning, New Zealand First MP Jenny Marcroft asked what criteria were being considered to move the country down to alert level 1. Health Minister Chris Hipkins said there could still be cases in the community at the lowest two alert levels, as long as they were contained. "The real test is different levels of containment at level two and at level one, rather than complete elimination before you'd move to alert level one. "We [Cabinet] haven't yet considered any advice on a shift from level two to level one," Hipkins said. Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said officials were not yet considering moving Auckland and the rest of the country to alert level 1. Instead, the focus was on moving Auckland from alert level 2.5 to 2. Level 2.5 in Auckland "won't last forever", Hipkins told the Committee, and was likely to change "soon". Dr Bloomfield offered the Select Committee an explanation as to why hundred of thousands of Aucklanders were advised to get an unnecessary Covid-19 test. Everyone in West and South Auckland was wrongly advised at the weekend to get a test, regardless of whether they were showing symptoms. The unclear advice made Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern "incredibly angry" and work was being done to correct it, she said on Sunday. Bloomfield said when social media messaging was prepared, key words were missed out, which lead to a "completely different" message being made public. A schedule for regular testing of border and managed isolation workers will be released by the end of the week, Hipkins told the Health Select Committee. Workers at the highest risk will be tested weekly, he said. Lower risk workers will be tested fortnightly and those on the periphery could have monthly tests. Shipping ports were the most complex places to conduct testing, "because of the nature of what they do and the huge volume of people that interact with the port," Hipkins said. Many workers had next to no potential exposure, he said, while others had quite a high level. Officials have been working with port companies to establish a testing regime. "There are thousands of people there, many different employers trying to do the right thing, and [some have] quite irregular contact with the ports. So if you're a driver coming to and from the port, for example, you're not always going to be there at the same time. "So we've been working to identify what are the peaks for when testing capability needs to be there. Shift changes are a good example," Hipkins said.

Judith Collins has called for James Shaw to resign over pushing for an $11.7m grant for a private school. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "I'm surprised he didn't resign yesterday.

"This is totally unacceptable." Collins said about 400 people lost their jobs every day last week and approving the projects was important to ensure organisations had certainty about upcoming work. Shaw has apologised for his mistake in approving the grant to the private school, despite the Green Party having a policy against public funding for private schools. He hoped the grant might be treated as a loan. Collins said other Taranaki schools badly needed more funding and she supported more funding for public schools and integrated schools.

Green School New Zealand. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin Yesterday, Shaw said he now wanted the funding all converted into a loan. However, Green School chief executive Chris Edwards told Morning Report most of it was going to be a loan anyway. "Just to be clear, never ever was this a 100 percent grant. The application ... was for 25 percent grant and the rest was a series of loans." Although he could not say whether that meant the money could be completely pulled. "We feel very, very strongly about this situation, so I don't know the answer, my understanding though is that a contract actually has been signed in some form and that we're actually waiting for information from [the Crown infrastructure partnership] as to what the nature of the funds will look like." Edwards said he wanted to clarify any public misconception that the funding was taken away from the public education sector, which he supported. "If for example we were to return the funding - and I see there's a lot of misinformation in public discourse - let's just say we did that for a moment, and pleased some people in election season, my understanding there is that not a penny there goes back into the public sector for example it's not an education fund, and also not a penny of that comes back to Taranaki. "We applied for a job-creating values-based community-rich fund that was going to help the Taranaki community. "I understand the optics by the way, if you just read the headlines I completely understand why people think what they think. "It was a Covid specific fund for shovel ready infrastructure projects, not a penny of which came from any education funds. "I've been in education for 30 years, I'm now mortified to hear somehow Green School is being set up in a binary position against the public sector." He said he saw the school as "the baby left on top of the mountain" because it was election year. But the school is also facing controversy from another space, with a person claiming on their website that their partner planned to plant a crystal grid on school property with students. Edwards said there were many people and organisations who used their campus, but that the school did necessarily endorse all views. He did not deny the school's campus had been used by the individual, but added he was not in attendance. "I didn't attend that event, lots and lots of people in the school didn't attend that event, I don't actually know what happened there. It is simply somebody who used the campus and that's fine, we're not going to stop people from doing that if they so wish. "Any students included in that - if they're from the school or not - would be voluntary. This is on an individual's website, not the school's. So I feel it's very difficult for me to talk about the beliefs and behaviours of another individual ." Asked on how that would reflect on the school, he said it was up to the public to form their opinions but he was clear it was not part of their curriculum nor on their website. "I'm trying to be as honest and open as I can. People will have to make up their own minds about the school's image when the CEO of the school says the school does not endorse it, it is not part of the curriculum. And if people decide what's on an individual's website is reflective of the school, then I can't help that. I can only say what I'm saying now repeatedly very honestly to you." He said the unfolding events and controversy had taken a toll. "I think this week has been the unhappiest week of my professional life. I feel that we've been drawn into something that we never intended to be involved in."

Judith Collins has denied any knowledge of a National Party ad that said it was authorised by her. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone The Speaker of the House, Trevor Mallard, told the National Party to remove the "misleading" social media ad, which looked like it was written on letterhead from Labour's Health Minister Chris Hipkins. The ad suggested Hipkins had said it was not compulsory for people to have a Covid-19 test on day three in managed isolation. However, this information is incorrect, because people cannot leave isolation for an extra 14 days if they refuse to have a test. Collins agreed it was wrong for National to publish an ad that appeared to be on a Labour minister's letterhead and said the ad had been removed. "I didn't even know about the ad, which I was really quite annoyed about," she said. "The use of my name was in fact unacceptable and unauthorised by me. "You can imagine it's going to be sorted." Collins said Covid-19 tests could produce false negative results, so the National Party supported compulsory testing before people travelled to New Zealand. "We can't afford to go in and out of lockdown, because some people think it doesn't apply to them," she said. Collins' husband of 41 years, David Wong-Tung, has been criticised for sharing Facebook posts that some regard as racist or sexist. Collins said her husband made his own decisions. "I've always believed a woman doesn't have to answer for her husband." Earlier this year, the National Party lost an appeal to the Advertising Standards Authority over another ad that was deemed misleading.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/425009/james-shaw-may-get-some-reprieve-if-green-school-funding-treated-as-loan|2020-09-02|Analysis - James Shaw's ministerial colleagues have not exactly rushed to help him out after he delivered a massive 'mea culpa' over the funding decision for the private Green School. James Shaw yesterday apologised for "an error of judgement" over the funding of the private Green School in Taranaki. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone The Greens' co-leader and government minister has fronted up and apologised to a long list of those outraged by his active support of the nearly $12 million grant, but still with no solution. One may be on the horizon though - with the school telling RNZ it is open to much of the money it was promised being treated as a loan. Chief executive of the Taranaki Green School, Chris Edwards, says it was never meant to be a grant. "There was a small portion that was going to be a grant and the other elements were essentially loans." But when asked to clarify whether it was now considered a grant or not, Edwards said: "I can't really answer that question, not because I'm dodging it, but because I'm not responsible for that application. But I do know that there are conversations going on now to see if we can use the funds in as creative a manner as possible so that they will benefit the community." Edwards could not say whether the school's owners would be willing to give the money back but said "as it stands the vast majority will be [a loan]". New Zealand First leader Winston Peters and Shaw have had increasingly fractious public exchanges in recent months, and this week was no different. Peters says this is a "mistake of bad fiscals, bad understanding of the marketplace, and worse still of a very, very uncertain applicant". And he put the decision down to Shaw's lack of political experience: "You cannot go on making mistakes in this business ... we've stopped things that were a silly idea and promoted things that are good idea." It was Shaw's "number one priority" to get the funding through, says Peters, and this is a case "where the blame stops with the person who's now saying he's sorry that he did that". It's still not clear whether there is a contract in place between the Green School and Crown Infrastructure Partners Limited (CIP). The only reference to what the money would be spent on in Shaw's August announcement was on "a 'shovel-ready' project [to] enable Green School to expand its student roll from 120 students to 250 ... it is estimated that a roll of 250 students will contribute $43 million each year for the local economy". "The support we are providing will help Green School to meet growing demand from parents all over New Zealand, and the rest of the world, wanting to enrol their children." This has all happened under a $3 billion fund for 'shovel-ready' projects around the country, not only to build infrastructure but also to create jobs. The exact make-up of the $11.7m announced for Green School is not known, with other contracts negotiated by CIP having a mix of loans and straight grants. A major concern of Treasury in opposing the funding was it did not yet have the full education approvals needed for a private school. Advice obtained by RNZ from around July said without full private school registration, it would be "inappropriate" to give Green School government money, but even then it opposed the grant. Green School has provisional registration, says the advice, but it would it be still be some time before it was a fully registered private school, as Treasury says the "Education Review Office (ERO) is planning to visit the school in 2021, so if they are successful in receiving full registration this is unlikely until mid-2021". Education Minister Chris Hipkins told Parliament he was not involved in signing off the grant, but did "have a conversation about the application with James Shaw towards the end of July and I gave him feedback that from an educational portfolio perspective the school would not be a priority for investment". And he's distancing himself from the school itself saying he wouldn't send his own kids there. Hipkins says parents make their own choices about removing their children from the state system: "Look, I wouldn't send my kids to a private school.'' Some private schools "may go through building projects before they've completely registered as a private school," he says, and from an educational viewpoint that's not unusual. Nor is it unusual for Treasury to have "strongly held" views, Hipkins says. "Private schools do what they want - they're private businesses.'' While they have to teach broadly to the New Zealand curriculum, they do have more freedom in that regard, he says. Finance Minister Grant Robertson told the House 1900 applications were initially received and Crown Infrastructure Partners shortlisted that down to just over 800. "Ministers were then responsible for refining that down further to the around 150 projects that have been put in place ... Minister Shaw is on record for his strong advocacy of the particular project in question here.'' Robertson says he does not see a backlash for Labour or New Zealand First as a result of the decision-making. "I think everybody in the situation is clear that it was Minister Shaw's strong advocacy that saw the Green School (succeed), and he himself has acknowledged that.'' Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the money committed to the Green School has not come at the expense of the more than $2 billion of infrastructure upgrades for schools across the country. She says the government has been committed to bolstering the quality of public schooling infrastructure. "This project is about job creation, it creates 200 jobs and that's why it was seen so favourably by the Crown infrastructure process.''

Gerry Brownlee says he hopes the opportunity to use CovidCard has not been lost. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Tech entrepreneur Sam Morgan has walked away from CovidCard, saying he was frustrated with the project being bogged down with bureaucracy. But Government Digital Services Minister Kris Faafoi said two trials will still go ahead this month. The government does have a licence to use CovidCard technology. But Morgan said he did not see how the card could successfully go ahead without his team. National's Covid-19 border response spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said the situation was unfortunate. "We can't keep living in this yo-yoing in and out of lockdown, we have to be able to very rapidly contact trace and even though we are being told that is happening at the moment, something like the CovidCard would achieve that much much more quickly," he said. Brownlee said there has not been a quick enough reaction from the government on using the bluetooth technology. "When it was finally decided there will be a roll out, clearly it hasn't gone as well as was touted to the public," he said. He said he hoped the opportunity to use CovidCard will not be lost, as National sees a place for the technology in its border protection policy. "It is very important for the minister to clarify in the next very short time exactly what has happened here," he said.

Minister of digital services, Kris Faafoi.

But tech entrepreneur Sam Morgan said he did not see how the card could successfully go ahead without his team even though he did not own the technology. His team had written the software, procured the card design, and organised a factory to make them. The Ministry of Health's IT team were not up to the task, he said. Government Digital Services Minister Kris Faafoi said Morgan was not the only brains behind the card and the project was not in jeopardy "I know Sam is frustrated, I can't control Sam's feelings on a day-to-day basis, but we are committed to making sure we have a trial in Rotorua," he said. Morgan said the government was taking too long and the CovidCard was being bogged down by bureaucracy and Ministry of Health middle management. He said he was frustrated the government was again considering using Apple and Google data which was inaccurate and would not work well for New Zealand, for contact tracing. Faafoi said the government had to take time to consider the best solution, especially as it was likely to cost more than $100 million. Any decision had to be based on whether the card would work and people would be prepared to use it, he said. Megan Woods. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Minister in charge of managed isolation and quarantine Megan Woods said there were two trials of the CovidCard - a community trial in Rotorua and another that the government would use within managed isolation and quarantine facilities for staff and returnees. Morgan's withdrawal from working with CovidCard would have no impact on the latter, Woods said. "We are still [in] a position to keep working through [that] and we are working through where that trial will be. We have a couple of contenders of isolation facilities where it will be useful as a tool to track contacts within a facility, but that is quite separate from the Rotorua trial." Woods said the managed isolation trial had not involved Morgan. The CovidCard can be worn or carried by people and would send and receive digital signals to and from other cards around it. That data would then be used to identify those who may have been close enough to someone with Covid to mean they were also at risk. It would remove the need for people to have to remember - or bother - to use their Covid Tracer App. The government was also trialling leaving a card in lifts in managed isolation hotels to see if it could successfully trace if people had been in high risk areas. The Ministry of Health's data and digital director general Shayne Hunter confirmed it was continuing to work with other people in the private sector on the card. He said it needed to assess how it would work in real life situations. "The country is dealing with a tricky virus and we need a number of effective tools to fight Covid-19," he said.

The video, which was posted by Ross' Advance NZ party and that of Billy Te Kahika's NZ Public Party, which have merged, included edited Parliamentary footage of an exchange between government minister Megan Woods and National's Erica Stanford.

The petition was handed over to minister for workplace relations, Andrew Little, outside Parliament today. Photo: RNZ / Yvette McCullough Workplace Relations Minister Andrew Little received the petition, which was handed over by a small contingent of people who work in essential services in a mock giant tissue box. It calls for an extension of the Covid-19 Leave Support Scheme for the next year, and for paid sick leave to increase to a minimum of 10 days. Council of Trade Unions president Richard Wagstaff said the requirement to stay home if you are unwell was impossible to follow with just five days leave. "We need more sick leave. We need people to be able to get it from the day they start work; they need more per year, they need 10 days a year; they need to be able to look after their dependants; we need to get rid of the doctor's certificate. "I really hope that the next government and the political parties leading into the election can support this petition", Wagstaff said. Little said sick leave entitlement was an important conversation for Parliament to be having. He said Covid-19 had shown how vital the essential workforce was, but it had also exposed shortcomings in some employment arrangements. "I think it is timely to now ask questions about do our laws go far enough, do those basic minimum protections for workers in the face of a health crisis go far enough? This petition does that so it will be fertile ground for Parliament to consider," he said. Little said the Labour Party would announce its policy on sick leave in the coming weeks. Green MP Jan Logie was also there to receive the petition. Her party has already pushed for sick leave to increase to a minimum of 10 days. She said research showed that one third of New Zealanders were going to work sick because they did not have enough leave. "That's costing businesses, because other people get sick when people go to work sick but we get to see now in the light of Covid that it is costing us as a country and putting us all at risk and we need to do something about it."

Green School New Zealand. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin Greens co-leader James Shaw has apologised for the decision to sign off on the grant, calling it an error of judgement, after a massive backlash. The Treasury advice to Shaw and the others ministers who signed off on hundreds of projects for infrastructure investment says the Green School does not have "full private school registration" and would be unlikely to get that until mid 2021. "We believe it would be inappropriate to announce or provide government funding for a project that does not yet have the necessary education approvals," the advice says. Furthermore, it says even if it had the "necessary" approvals, "we do not recommend funding for this school". Treasury also objected to the project being overseen by the Provincial Development Unit saying it was not the "appropriate agency for this school". "If this option is progressed, MOE [Ministry of Education] should be the responsible agency as it is the steward of the Education Act, and has the experience required to ensure the school gets the right network provision in place, and education system oversight going forward."

Watch James Shaw speaking here: The National Party has been ramping up the pressure on Shaw, saying if there's no contract in place, the deal should be off. Shaw, also Associate Finance Minister, received backlash after he and other ministers signed off on $11.7m to allow the school to expand. "I want you to know I have taken the time to reflect on your concerns and I'm acting on them," Shaw said to critics of the funding. "Every dollar we've invested is a dollar to create jobs," he said of the shovel-ready funds. He said he saw an opportunity to employ hundreds of people in an area most affected by the government's decision to support renewables. He said it was a fair question to ask why the government doesn't fund public schools with run-down buildings. Shaw said the previous government left schools in these systematically underfunded conditions and it was clear funding was not reaching them fast enough. "If the last few days have shown us anything, it's that New Zealanders are incredibly passionate about their public education." He said the Green Party shares that passion. "Progress towards our better future requires tough choices. Not everyone one of those choices is going to be the right one," Shaw said. He apologised to schools and people who felt disaffected by the decisions. "I want you to know I have listened to your concerns." Representatives of the Green School have approached the Crown to find a solution. RNZ earlier reported it understood the solution would be to covert all or part of the nearly $12 million into a loan. Shaw said ministers cannot engage in the process. "My personal view is that the best way to do this is for the support for the Green School to come in the form of a loan rather than a grant." "When you make a mistake, you should learn from it for the future," he said. Shaw said it was clear to him "very early on" he had made an error of judgement. He said it's not appropriate for him to get in the middle of negotiations between the partners and the Crown. Shaw said he won't get dragged into stories about what the parents are doing. He said it was not a caucus decision to provide the funding and Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said Shaw fronted up quickly on the error. The school's reputation has "taken a battering" from the funding decision and controversy, Shaw said. National's leader Judith Collins and MPs visited New Plymouth yesterday, announcing a big education spending policy, but also to rally support against the Green School grant. She cited comments made by the principal of one Taranaki school, Marfell Community School, and the "absolute anger" over money given to a private school when their school is desperate for funding. "It's a decile 1 school, it has the principal spending four out of five days a week trying to fundraise," Collins told reporters. "They have no extra money from parents because the parents don't have any extra money at all. Their absolutely reliant on essentially community trusts, particularly pokie funds to actually be able to buy anything for this school, including the principal having to make the curtains." She would also like to see the business case and Treasury advice ministers relied on before signing off on the $11.7m. Shaw yesterday told student radio station 95bFM he "missed the fact" about funding and private schools. "I mean... I knew it was a school obviously, a private school, but it didn't occur to me that we had an exclusion on funding of private schools," Shaw told 95bFM. Finance Minister Grant Robertson was adamant the deal had been done when asked yesterday. "I know that Minister Shaw is seeking to come up with another plan, but I haven't heard back from him about what that is, but as I say, I think it's an issue of good faith. "If the government says it's going to fund something, we have to go through with that even if one of our partners might regret it," Robertson said.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/424934/taranaki-school-dependent-on-pokie-funds-judith-collins|2020-09-01|Watch Judith Collins addressing the media here: The National Party's caucus has been meeting the day after its leader announced a $4.8 billion spend-up on education infrastructure. The funding policy was announced in New Plymouth and at her post-caucus briefing today Collins was keen to pursue the controversy surrounding the government's decision to give $11.7 million to the region's Green School to help it expand. Yesterday Collins met with the principals of Marfell School and New Plymouth Boys' High School. "What was really clear is the absolute anger amongst the school principals and the school communities about the $11.7 million that has been promised by the government to this thing called a Green School when the schools themselves in New Plymouth - many are suffering, particularly Marfell and Boys' High, from a deficit of infrastructure particularly around the school buildings." Collins said Marfell School is a decile 1 school, where the principal spends four out of five days a week trying to fundraise. It was reliant on community trusts particularly pokie funds and its TV and IT equipment had been donated. Parents were too hard up to provide any extra money, she said. New Plymouth Boys' was also desperate for more money. "They're looking at this Green School, private school, and wondering what is going on with the government and they certainly did not expect that would happen." National would take the issue up again with the government today, Collins said. She wanted to see the business case, and especially any information supplied by Treasury. At the weekend Newshub reported that students at the Green School worked with crystals. During her visit growing crystals and planting them did not seem to be of much interest to people in New Plymouth, Collins said. If there was no contract, the government should cancel the project now, if papers had been signed, the government owed people an explanation. She accused the previous Labour government, under Helen Clark, of underspending on school infrastructure during its time in power and leaving National "a complete mess". If elected, National would spend $2 billion to pay for repairing and rebuilding schools. "It's really clear they do need more money." In a time of unemployment, 400 people a day were losing their jobs, as of last week, so local businesses where schools were based would be involved as much as possible. "Not only will we fund them, we will get them done faster," said Nicola Willis, the party's spokesperson on education. Despite the prevalence of genome testing, the government had not identified the source of the latest Covid-19 outbreak weeks after it first appeared. "What we're seeing is the quarantining that has gone on has not necessarily been optimal." Taiwan was the standout country in the world for its Covid-19 response and New Zealand needed to have a single border agency, as proposed by National, Collins said. Collins said people in Invercargill were "grumpy" about being in alert level 2 when she visited the city at the end of last week. "We don't have the same information the government has so it would be unwise for us to jump to conclusions when we don't have it." Collins repeated that she is not in favour of the mosque gunman, who was sentenced to life in jail without parole last week, serving out his time in his home country of Australia. New Zealand has never had a policy of allowing serving prisoners to complete their sentence in another country, she said. The deputy prime minister had taken a populist view with his opinion of sending the terrorist to Australia. She refused to take questions about her husband sharing a number of anti-Jacinda Ardern posts on Facebook. David Wong-Tung, a businessman and former police officer, shared an array of posts attacking Ardern - his wife's political opponent. In the posts, the Labour leader is mocked and called names - among them - the incredible sulk and Cindy. One message calls for her to be tested - not for Covid-19, but for competency.

Education Minister Chris Hipkins. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Around 250,000 children were expected to return yesterday as Auckland moved to alert level 2.5. but many stayed away. Principals say parents are more fearful following Auckland's second outbreak and they would rather not take the risk of sending their children back to school. Hipkins told Morning Report he wouldn't be asking students to go back if he thought it would put them at risk. "All of the new cases that we're seeing of Covid-19 in the Auckland community are coming from known contacts so these were people who were already isolating so they wouldn't be in school and they wouldn't be in the workplace. "That should give people reassurance that this cluster is being contained and therefore our decision to move down to alert level 2 is a justified one." Hipkins said cases where there was a connection with a school were identified some time ago, the students and those around them had been tested, and the incubation period had long passed. "We wouldn't be asking schools to reopen if we thought that was going to place students at risk. "There is no good reason not to be sending your kids back to school at the moment." While schools can use masks there was no plan to make them mandatory. "One of the challenges with young people is that it's difficult to make sure that they keep them on and sometimes if you've got kids taking masks on and off the value of those masks quickly disappears and you potentially increase risk. "The current health advice is that in a school setting masks wouldn't necessarily increase protection and in fact could do the opposite. The Taranaki Secondary Schools Principals' Association is demanding answers from the education minister about the private Green School receiving almost $12 million in government funding. They've written an open leader to minister Hipkins about the school receiving funding as a 'shovel ready' project. In the letter, association chair Martin Chamberlain said members were united in their opposition to the Green School funding. "While we see environmentally-based education as laudable, and 'shovel- ready' funding to assist our present economic situation as sensible, we cannot accept taxpayer funding being directed to individuals who will privately own the expanded asset and profit from the venture," Chamberlain wrote. "There is dire need for this funding in our state and state integrated schools." He asked the minister to explain himself. "Were you aware of all the ramifications when you signed off on this particular project, if not why not? "If you were not fully aware of these issues, what do you propose to do by way of remedy?" Hipkins told Morning Report the money was coming out of economic development funding for shovel-ready projects, not education funding, and he was not one of the authorising ministers. He said the government was spending nearly $3 billion on new schools, expansions, refurbishments, redevelopments and deferred maintenance projects in state schools. "That's a lot of investment in our state school system."

James Shaw. Photo: Pool / Stuff / Kevin Stent Shaw, also associate finance minister, has been under increasing pressure for signing off on the cash, alongside other ministers from Labour and New Zealand First - allocated from the $3 billion "shovel-ready" projects fund. The backlash is due to the Greens position on private schools - they do not support giving them taxpayer funding. "I simply missed the fact, I mean...I knew it was a school obviously, a private school, but it didn't occur to me that we had an exclusion on funding of private schools," Shaw told student radio station 95bFM. Shaw will be wishing he remembered his party's long-held stance not to fund private schools before approving almost $12 million for Green School New Zealand in Taranaki. He has already apologised to hundreds of furious Green Party members, but some have told RNZ it is not enough. They want Shaw to issue a public apology and for the party to produce a public education package to cement its stance on private school funding. The co-leader declined to speak to RNZ, but told student radio 95bFM he was working to find a solution. "The Crown has entered into this agreement in good faith with the green school and so it is important for us to fulfill our commitment there. But we also recognise that it obviously landed very badly with the public and in particular with teachers and principals of those schools that haven't yet received the funding that the Crown's allocated towards them. "I can't say what the resolution will look like," Shaw said. Finance minister Grant Roberston was adamant the deal had been done. "I know that Minister Shaw is seeking to come up with another plan, but I haven't heard back from him about what that is, but as I say, I think it's an issue of good faith. "If the government says it's going to fund something, we have to go through with that even if one of our partners might regret it," Robertson said. National leader Judith Collins made the most of the mess by today announcing her party's education infrastructure policy at a state school in Taranaki. "It's a decile 1, it's in desperate need of some renewal of the buildings but also you've got to really committed teaching staff who are trying to do their very best and it's just a total kick in the guts for them to hear about this flash green school thing, suddenly getting all this money for capital expenditure and we've got kids at Marfell [school] who are trying to learn at buildings that are well past their use-by date," Collins said. The party is promising to spend almost $5 billion on fast-tracking education infrastructure if elected in October. Some $2.8 billion would be put towards its school growth plan, which is yet to be developed, and $2 billion would be spent on an alliance of builders, educators and architects over five years on repairing, redeveloping and rebuilding schools.

File image. Photo: RNZ/ Nick Monro The damning inquiry, released in April, found that the EQC was woefully unprepared as it dealt with the Canterbury quakes. It made a raft of recommendations around clarifying EQC's role and improving the way it deals with claimants. EQC minister Grant Robertson said the government accepted in principle or will be doing more work on all of the inquiry's 70 recommendations. He said the government was "adamant no other community should live through botched repairs and years of trauma and uncertainty following a significant natural disaster". The government's response comes in a week that marks 10 years since the Darfield-centred quake - the first in a series which wreaked havoc in Canterbury. Robertson said this was just the start and for many the real trauma came from their dealings with EQC. "The stories that were heard during the inquiry were heartbreaking. Lives no hold, lives disrupted, for some never the same again. This government has committed itself to learning the lessons from this," he said. Watch interview with Greater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Megan Woods: Robertson said EQC was doomed to fail and it should have been obvious to the previous government that it was "hopelessly underprepared" to manage the flood of nearly half a million claims. "As the inquiry noted, given the repair programme to EQC was quote 'a mistake', resulting in botched repairs that frequently failed to fix all the damage to a property or in some cases didn't fix any damage at all ... we expect to introduce legislation in the middle of next year to modernise the EQC Act. The new Act will respond to many recommendations in the Inquiry's report, providing certainty for claimants and agencies involved in responding to natural disaster." Robertson said work was still being done on the question of who would manage a repair programme in the future and whether to raise EQC's liability cap of $150,000. Former EQC and Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said it was "utterly ridiculous" to say his government should have known EQC was unprepared and it would be like him saying the current government have "shown themselves to be hopelessly underprepared and inadequate to deal with a pandemic". Gerry Brownlee. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas "You don't have a standing army waiting around for a natural disaster, and that's what would have had to have happened... this was effectively one in a 1600 year event, absolutely massive, and the fourth biggest insurance disaster in the world up until that point", he said. He also defended giving the repair programme to EQC as at the time there were "all sorts of people who turned up in Christchurch doing temporary fixes on people's homes". "To have left the city with so many houses so badly damaged, 267,000 houses damaged that EQC dealt with, without some clear track of recourse in the event of any failure would have been a massive mistake. "And I find it fascinating that this word 'botched' keeps coming up when in fact the return rate on EQC repairs is less than on new builds", Brownlee said. The Claimants Reference Group welcomed the government's response, but its chair Ali Jones was concerned claimants may still not be put at the centre. "It's great that we're looking at the Act, it's great that we're looking at partnerships, but let's remember that it's the claimant that is at the centre of this and it's the claimant's voice that needs to be considered every single step of the way. She also felt that some key points had been missed. "The nightmare and upset that claimants experienced was as a direct result of failed damage assessments and failed repairs. So where is the information around how that is going to be addressed?," Jones said. Sid Miller. Photo: Supplied / ACC EQC chief executive Sid Miller said they had already implemented some major changes, including implementing more efficient claims processes and building stronger partnerships with other agencies when responding to natural disasters. He said quality assurance would be a key element of any future response, and the organisation was committed to putting customers first. "I don't think we can ever draw that line in the sand for those people and what they've experienced, we've made an apology and we recognise that. "I think I look at it about learning from the experience those people have had and that's the focus on our organisation, so how do we improve so that people don't have to go through the same experience in the future."

File photo. Photo: 123RF The public consultation is the first under the new Building for Climate Change programme - the sector's contribution to New Zealand's goal of zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment says there are three aims - to reduce a building's emissions, reduce water use, and improve people's health through things like indoor humidity and ventilation. The rule would apply to all new buildings, including housing, commercial, and industrial buildings. The plan discusses setting annual caps on emissions for every square metre of a building, which would include efficient energy use, thermal performance, potable water requirements and limits on the use of fossil fuels. It would also include a set of measurable requirements for indoor environmental quality. There's also a plan to apply some changes to existing buildings in the future. "As new buildings have yet to be built, they present an immediate and urgent opportunity to meet the objectives. However, the buildings that currently exist in 2020 are predicted to make up 65 percent of New Zealand's building stock in 2050 and a similar proportion of emissions," the consultation document says. "It is proposed that changes to existing buildings will be addressed in future work by the Building for Climate Change programme." Submissions close in 4 weeks.

It would spend a further $2bn to fund an alliance of builders, educators and architects over five years on repairing, redeveloping and rebuilding schools. This would be allocated based on roll size, building age, condition and community need. National's education spokesperson Nicola Willis said the government had not done enough to prepare for the 100,000 school places expected to be required over the next 10 years. "Too many schools wait too long for the new classrooms they need, forcing them to convert libraries and halls into teaching spaces. This is bad for teaching and learning, and it reduces the facilities that should be available to schools. This must change. Nicola Willis. Photo: Supplied / National Party website "While the potential demographic impact of Covid-19 is still unclear, it's likely that Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga and Queenstown will need extra investment to accommodate students as their populations grow," she said. Schools would continue to receive existing property maintenance grants for work on Ministry of Education-owned buildings, as well as funding for capital upgrades allocated through the five-year agreement process. The alliance would be used to streamline major repair and redevelopment projects costing more than $100,000 for the next five years. Schools could also use it to finish delivering any existing or planned projects worth more than $100,000. Collins said the alliance would be incentivised to use local and small business sub-contractors. "By creating a collaborative team approach, major contractors can bring professional disciplines to bare, buy material in bulk, find economies of scale and share knowledge. "This will be particularly beneficial given the large number of school repair projects that are similar in nature. It will create certainty for the building sector by providing a clear pipeline of work and allowing them to develop expertise in school repair," she said.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wears a mask and holds a 3D model of the coronavirus during a visit to ESR in Porirua on 20 August 2020. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas She told Morning Report Covid cannot only be managed at levels 3 and 4. She says the move to level 2.5 while the Auckland cluster continues to grow is what the system is designed for. Ardern said she received advice that restrictions of gatherings in Auckland to a limit of 10 was "very important". "You'll see from the alert level framework that we set from the very beginning of this pandemic, it has anticipated being at level 2 whilst we're managing cases. "Our system is designed to be able to do that. What we need to ensure is that we've got really good compliance with the other things we expect at level 2 in order to be able to make that work." Ardern said everyone must play their part by social distancing and wearing masks. "Masks are not a substitute for keeping our distance. "If we all play our role, then we are able to continue to manage the cases that we do have in a 2.5 environment." However, some experts warn it's too early to move from alert level 3 in Auckland. The National Mori Pandemic Group says the Auckland cluster of Covid-19 cases isn't well enough contained for the region to move down a level. Te Rp Whakakaupapa Urut had urged the government to halt the relaxation of restrictions while community transmission of the virus is at current levels. Co-leader professor Sue Crengle told Morning Report a number of the sub-clusters weren't well defined. Though the majority of cases were linked to the main cluster, there were still one or two where there is no clear epidemiological pathway even though there is a genomic pathway, she said. "We still don't think that the perimeter is really well described and contained even though it looks like it's one large cluster with some sub-clusters. The group would have liked to see a "small amount of time at a higher level" while new cases were monitored over the next few days. With Aucklanders now able to travel out of the region, New Zealand would be depending on them to take precautions against the spread of the virus, she said. Covid-19 data modelling expert Shaun Hendy yesterday said the government should consider extending level 3. Hendy was concerned by the number of cases that had been picked up through community testing instead of via contact tracing. He said easing the travel restrictions meant people could spread the infection to other parts of the country. And epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker said the move to alert level 2 could see a growth in the case rate. "It does suggest if we reduce the controls starting tomorrow that that transmission will not go away and it may actually drift up, or track up, over the next few weeks. Ardern said restrictions aren't the only way to manage the virus and places like Taiwan are almost solely reliant on contact tracing. "We've talked about the fact that there have been some scenarios where, had we had a singular case we could trace back to the source right from the beginning, we might not have had to move alert levels at all. "Restrictions alone are not the only way we manage this virus. We have many tools, we just need to make sure we deploy them properly." Ardern said regional boundaries are difficult for the many thousands of people who travel across the country for legitimate purposes and general precautions across New Zealand the trade-off for lower restrictions in Auckland. She said we took graduated moves through alert levels last time around so level '2.5' shouldn't be too confusing. "We didn't go immediately to mass gatherings of 100 people, we had a limit of 10 in the beginning. We did that last time and some people started loosely using the term 2.5 at that time." Ardern said the new thing this time around is mask use and that we have to be willing to learn and adapt to new practices to combat the pandemic. An Instagram message from the Ministry of Health this weekend incorrectly urged anyone in West or South Auckland to get tested. Ardern said she's sorry for people who felt anxiety from the incorrect messaging on Instagram and the government moved quickly to correct it. "It was frustrating but, as I've said, if we were going to urge 700,000 people to get a test, we wouldn't have shared that message solely through Instagram - you would've heard that from us." Crengle said the wrong call on testing for West and South Auckland would have meant people without symptoms were tested, so wasn't the worst error to happen. "Anyone can make a mistake, and we have to have some aroha for the person or people who made that mistake. It was cleared up relatively quickly and in some ways it was a message that would have people who were asymptomatic tested rather than actually discouraging people from testing," Crengle said. "If you're going to make a mistake that wasn't a bad one to make. "It was cleared up very quickly, the prime minister was very clear yesterday, and hopefully it will mean anyone putting messaging out will be very cautious and double and triple check what they're messaging."

A man wearing a mask collects takeaways near Auckland's Queen Street. File photo. Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook But it isn't completely joining the rest of the country in level 2, instead moving to what Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is calling "level 2.5". Aucklanders still face greater restrictions, with gatherings capped at 10 people and authorised funerals and tangihanga at 50. "I cannot stress how important this is. Much of this cluster has stemmed from social gatherings. If we want to stop the spread we have to stop socialising for a time,"Ardern said. From today, masks are mandatory on public transport and planes across the country for everyone over 12. But Ardern made this extra appeal to Aucklanders. "If you go to a shop wear a mask. If you go to a mall where a mask. Basically when you step out of your home we are asking you if you can please wear a mask," she said. Ardern said these rules aren't just for the city of Auckland - and Aucklanders should stick to them even if they travel outside of the region. "Please don't just pop into an aged care facility no matter where it is in the country. Please don't attend a mass gathering even if it's not in Auckland and if you are sick stay home, definitely don't travel," Ardern said. Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said this was a common sense requirement. "No Aucklander wants to be the person that spreads the virus to other places and that's why we've got to be a little bit more careful. "We've got the right to travel, but let's make sure that we use that right responsibly and carefully," he said. Auckland Mayor Phil Goff says "complacency is the real enemy". Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook Goff said he was "celebrating" the new freedoms Aucklanders have, and while businesses were eager to get to full level 2, a cautious approach was necessary. "But really our ability to do that depends on all of us. Complacency is the real enemy and if people don't follow the rules and they take risks then that risks us going to a situation where the rules have got to be tightened," Goff said. National deputy leader Gerry Brownlee said if the health advice recommended caution then he supported that. "This is not for too long a period and we are stepping towards what our new normal is going to be OK I guess, but it's still a lot of disruption for people in Auckland and a lot of disruption for business activity," he said. But Brownlee thinks expecting Aucklanders to adhere to these rules outside of Auckland was "unrealistic". "If there's a gathering of 100 people in Christchurch for example and someone comes from Auckland are they really going to say 'look I better not go cos I'm from Auckland'? I just don't see how that works." ACT leader David Seymour believed the government was just "making up the system" as it went along. "Nobody imagined when we had four distinct levels that there would be a level 2.5. I think if there was a need for such a level it should have been communicated and established in the 102 days of Covid freedom. That's the period the government had time to prepare for an outbreak like this," he said. Seymour said the government needed to be a lot more deliberate, clear and prepared. But Ardern said this was the same as the "stepping down" phase the last time there was a move down from level 3. She said level 2 was designed to handle stamping out a cluster like this one, but this graduated step was needed to ensure no region has to move back up alert levels. Cabinet will review the country's settings again on Friday.

James Shaw said he is working to find a solution. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas The climate change Minister approved nearly $12 million for the 'green' school in Taranaki, despite his party's stance not to fund private schools. The money came from the government's $3 billion 'shovel ready' projects fund. Green School New Zealand, which opened in February, charges up to $24,000 a year for local students and up to $43,000 a year for international students. The school has about 50 students, half of whom come from overseas. The funding is designed to expand the school's capacity from 120 to 250 students. Shaw apologised to members in a Zoom meeting last night, saying he would not make the same decision if given another opportunity. He told the group of 460 people he had thought of the project as a building and construction project rather than an education one. He said he has listened to the concerns raised and is working to find a solution. Co-leader Marama Davidson was present in the meeting and acknowledged Shaw for owning his mistake. The country's largest education union wants the nearly $12m of funding allocated to Green School New Zealand to go back into public schools. Education Institute Te Riu Roa president Liam Rutherford said Shaw did the right thing by apologising, but it should not stop there. Rutherford said schools throughout Taranaki have plenty of construction opportunities that could benefit public education. The Greens' former education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty yesterday told Checkpoint she thought Shaw had become isolated from the party to some degree. She said his instinct failed to tell him that "this was never going to fly with the Green Party, and that our policies are never to fund private schools". Shaw had also come under fire from former Green Party MPs, Green candidates, the National Party and Taranaki schools principals for the funding decision.

Waiariki candidate Rawiri Waititi has taken the number 2 spot, and Ikaroa-Rwhiti candidate Heather Te Au-Skipworth is sitting at number 3. Mori Party president Che Wilson said the list reflected the party's diversity. "As the nation pivots from social need to economic recovery, we need leadership that is agile, energetic and principled," he said in a statement. "Our party list for the 2020 Elections reflects the visionary solution-focus of rangatahi leadership alongside of the tpuna-derived courage of our whine kahurangi, some who are currently leading the cause of the care of some of our most vulnerable children to the Waitangi Tribunal. "Aotearoa needs more than kindness - we need a brave direction that is fit for purpose in a much changed world; able to mobilise whnau, hap and iwi, and reflects the diversity of all our communities across the land." The candidates each had their own set of unique skills and life experiences, he said. "In our list we have champion athletes: the founder of Iron Mori (Heather Te Au Skipworth); a coordinator for the diploma in sport and recreation- and a crossfit trainer (Fallyn Flavell); a fourth dan black belt in aikido (Mariameno Kapa-Kingi) and competitive rower (Tumanako Silveria)," he said.

The NZX suffered trading halts from cyber attacks last week and faced some disruption today for a fifth day today, after distributed denial of service attacks took its website offline. Andrew Little, the minister overseeing the Government Communications Security Bureau(GCSB), said the NZX and other institutions received messages foreshadowing the attacks. The earliest warnings came through before attacks on the NZX last week, he said. Andrew Little Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "As I understand it, the organisations that came under attack received messages before these attacks saying that they would be attacked." Asked if any money or ransom was demanded, Little said: "I don't want to go into all the detail, that information is part of the investigation and it's a matter for those organisations". The attacks bore the hallmarks of criminal actors rather than a foreign state, but their motives were so far unknown, Little said. "The nature of distributed denial of service attacks is that they harness thousands of computers from around the world to send messages to this particular website and they can stop it functioning, basically," Little said. "Trying to troll your way through all of that is very difficult. There is an investigation involving including other Five Eyes partner countries... Little said the names of "state actors" had been used during the attacks, but that it was "looking increasingly likely that the use of those names are a decoy". Little said similar attacks were taking place in South East Asia and North America. The stock exchange's strengthened systems and back up measures held firm against further cyber attacks today. The NZX website came under early pressure and had several short-lived interruptions but trading was not disrupted. The company has beefed up its defences with help from the Government Communications Security Bureau and leading global IT company Akamai after last week's offshore based attacks cut short trading on four consecutive days. The benchmark top-50 index even managed to briefly set a record high before retreating to close more than 100 points or nearly 1 percent lower. Meanwhile, the GCSB has issued a set of guidelines and advice to companies to protect themselves against such attacks.

Judith Collins announces Tiwai Point smelter policy in Southland. Photo: RNZ / Tess Brunton The clock is already ticking down to the closure of the smelter near Bluff after owner Rio Tinto announces plans to close Rio Tinto released plans to shut it next August, ending its contract with Meridian Energy. National Party leader Judith Collins told an enthusiastic Southland crowd she was confident a commercial deal could be reached, preventing more than 2000 job losses across the region. Yunca Engineering has been supplying products and services to the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter since 1994. It was there at its Invercargill head office that National Party leader Judith Collins unveiled her vision for the smelter. "Our aim is to create a commercially viable result that will keep the smelter in operation for at least the next five years while preparing Southland to lessen the severity of any potential closure. We believe a commercial deal could be reached," Collins said. "It is our understanding that the owners of the Manapouri Power Station - Meridian Energy - have offered a positive electricity price to Rio Tinto, based on Meridian's potential losses of tens of millions of dollars a year if there is a drop-dead date for closure of the smelter. Based on this, we understand that a commercial deal could be reached. She promised a National Government would expedite negotiations between Rio Tinto, power companies and Transpower to ensure better transmission prices so the smelter could commit beyond its hard close date next August. Her other pledges include upgrading the smelter's technology to boost available electricity, improving Southland's internet and accelerating Transpower's investment in transmission lines. In exchange for the deal, she said Rio Tinto would need to show how it would clean up the site and deal with waste when it closed. Judith Collins announces Tiwai Point smelter policy in Southland. Photo: RNZ / Tess Brunton Deputy leader Gerry Brownlee said the company was willing to consider negotiating, but he wouldn't be pushed on financial figures. "Know when to hold them and know when to fold them," he said. "New Zealand Aluminium Smelter has put some numbers of the table, and we've considered those and have decided there is strong basis for negotiation." Judith Collins said part of the negotiation would include looking how to deal with the roughly 8500 tonnes of potentially toxic waste created by the smelter that has been sitting in a disused Mataura paper mill for years. When asked if there was a fallback plan, she said there was - but she was not going to reveal it. Instead Collins said she was focused on getting to work on negotiations straight away - if elected. Gore District Mayor Tracy Hicks said losing the smelter would be a devastating blow to Southland. National's plan was a positive step forward and recognised high transmission costs as one of the key barriers in negotiations, he said. "It's really going to take a strong government to intervene. They've given a signal today that they want to do that. "I wish them well. It's been a challenge for many years with a variety of governments and we haven't really got a lot of progress. So I've got high hopes, but we also got a commitment today that they would intervene in other ways if that was going to take longer than originally planned." Tracy Hicks believed a partnership between the government and the regions would be key. Invercargill City Mayor Sir Tim Shadbolt was also pleased with the pledge. "It's challenging, but it always has been when it comes to negotiations between the smelter and the electricity company," he said. Invercargill City mayor Sir Tim Shadbolt. Photo: RNZ / Tess Brunton "But this is a great time. People are positive now, they're looking for new projects they can possibly get behind and this will certainly benefit from any support they can possibly get." Halting the closure would give Southland more time to kickstart other industries, he said. "We realise that the smelter will not last forever. But we don't want money, we don't want subsidies. We don't want any of that. We just want fair pricing." Southland's leaders were not putting their eggs in one basket however, saying they were keen to hear from each political party about their plans for the smelter.

Independent MP Jami-Lee Ross describes the Speaker's action as a "draconian measure". Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook Trevor Mallard ordered the anti-vaccination video - posted by Ross's party and that of Billy Te Kahika's NZ Public Party - to be removed from social media, but that's been met with a blunt refusal. Parliamentary footage of an exchange between government minister Megan Woods and National's Erica Stanford was edited for use in the political ad, posted on several sites. Mallard considers it a potential breach of privilege and has referred it to Parliament's Privileges Committee - which has an extensive range of powers to censure MPs. It has a few days to at least consider the complaint, before deciding how and when to handle it. That means its members will have to get together (and that could be by video) by early next week. The committee is currently chaired by the Labour Party's David Parker, with the National Party's Gerry Brownlee as deputy, but ceases to exist once Parliament dissolves on 6 September. In a statement, Ross describes the Speaker's action as a "draconian measure... to try [to] censor a political party's videos in the middle of an Election campaign". "Billy Te Kahika and I will keep ruffling feathers and challenging the establishment," he says. "We will not blindly accept the Speaker's direction, and we will confront head on whatever Privileges Committee process lies ahead."

New Zealand First leader Winston Peters. Photo: RNZ Winston Peters applauded the sentencing, saying that it matched the depravity of the terrorist's crimes against the Islamic community and all New Zealanders. But he said the cost of keeping Brenton Tarrant in isolation should fall on the country that raised him. "I don't think the New Zealand taxpayers, after all this misery, should go ahead and be mugged and brutalised a second time year upon year at enormous cost," he said. Due to international obligations for the treatment of prisoners, the gunman has been kept in isolation to ensure his safety. Earlier this month it was revealed the special security measures will cost $3.6 million over two years. Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis declined RNZ's request for an interview. A spokesperson said he "would not comment on operational arrangements or the costs of managing this prisoner". Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was also reluctant to delve into the question yesterday, saying the focus should be on the families and victims. "I would say though that there isn't currently a legal basis for it. So it would be a very complex undertaking. I think the thing though, more than just the legal basis for it that I would be most interested in is the views of the family," she said. Peters accepted it would be complicated but said it was a complication worth sorting through. "If we've got to pass legislation to make it happen, if we've got to go to the Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton to request it we should. "Given the recent expulsions of New Zealanders out of Australia, some of whom only arrived there when they were three or four years of age and all their formative years were shaped by the Australia culture and system, I would've thought that's the least he could do," Peters said. National Party leader Judith Collins said given the vast impact and sheer hatred behind his crime, the sentence handed down was entirely appropriate. For her, the question of where he should see out the sentence is not complicated. "As a matter of principal he's done his crime here, as far as I'm concerned he can do his time here too and put up with a New Zealand prison where everyone knows what he has done," she said. Collins said setting principal aside - it would open New Zealand up for a tit for tat with the 900 odd New Zealanders in Australian prisons. "I realise that it's going to cost us a lot of money, but it would also cost us a tremendous amount more to take back all those New Zealanders who are currently in Australian prisons," she said. ACT leader David Seymour said while nothing could be proportional to this heinous crime, life without parole was the only rational choice. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas He too is rejecting Peters call for him to be deported to Australia. "It's legally impractical to send him back to Australia and I'm really saddened that Mr Peters has tried to make a political point on a day such as today," he said. Seymour said Corrections should be thinking about ways to trim the costs of accommodating him. Greens co-leader James Shaw felt the sentence has brought about a real sense of justice and closure. He believed most New Zealanders wanted him to see out his sentence in a prison in this country. "This guy committed the most foul act of terrorism on New Zealand's shores, you know, a mass murder event unparalleled in our history and I don't think that the mere cost of imprisonment would determine what you want to do with him," he said. Ardern said with the victims and families focused on the sentencing, this isn't a question she has yet asked them. She said their view will be a "big driver" in whether this is something the government even considers.

Green Party co-leader James Shaw. Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon It's not just principals, unions and the Opposition who are furious - his own party candidates and former MPs are ordering him to fix it. Not one, or two, but four former Green Party MPs couldn't hit social media fast enough to blast their party for backing taxpayer-funding of a private school in coastal akura. Sue Bradford described the move as incredible, and a total hand-out to the wealthy. Mojo Mathers took to Twitter to say she was furious, while Denise Roche warned the party's credibility was being ruined by such a move. Catherine Delahunty, who was a Green MP for nine years - holding the education portfolio for many of them, says she's astonished. "This is a mistake, fix the mistake and the electorate will respect you for it. Don't fix it and they will lose faith in you, it's that simple.'' Kealy Warren, acting principal of Marfell Community School - a low decile school in nearby New Plymouth, couldn't believe the news. "I felt physically sick, I wanted to vomit. I could not believe we were being so disrespected in favour of an elitist private school.'' She says it sent a message of worthlessness to her students. "I'm heartbroken for our beautiful children that have been told yet again you're the bottom of the heap stay there - what are you going to amount to? "You're the bottom of the heap, just stay there, you're not going to add to the economy when you grow up so sit there in your leaky classroom,'' she says. The Green Party co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson are in damage control and are holding an online meeting tonight with frustrated and disappointed party members. High-profile candidate Ricardo Menendez March is one of those, and has already gone public with his criticism. He says candidates are free to say when they disagree, and giving millions to a private school in Taranaki doesn't align with the party's policy. Shaw says he knows the state of public schools aren't good enough, but the government has allocated almost $2 billion towards fixing them - the money just hasn't reached most of them. "This is an area I think that New Zealand should be frankly ashamed of in terms of our continuing underinvestment in this area.'' Shaw says it's not true to say the Greens have abandoned their policy to not publicly fund private schools. "Well that is our policy and this money doesn't go into the operations." Asked if he was being cute, Shaw replied, "there's a balance of objectives we're trying to achieve here - remember that we are going through an unprecedented time with Covid-19''. Green School New Zealand. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin It's just a building, he says. "In terms of the infrastructure spend, it is in many ways just another construction project.'' Even Education Minister Chris Hipkins was ducking for cover when asked about it. "It's not necessarily a project I would have prioritised. That was something the Green Party advocated quite strongly for. "It was one of their wins, if you like, out of the shovel-ready project area, and so that's a question for them.'' So did Shaw even consult with his own caucus before making such a controversial decision? "Well it was under Budget secrecy, so whilst something is under Budget secrecy ministers can't talk beyond other ministers about that." He was the only Green Party MP that knew about it and agreed to it. As for the National Party, education spokesperson Nicola Willis says it's a joke. Shaw might find she's not alone in that opinion when he finally consults with his party later tonight.

A Covid-19 testing station in tara on 13 August. Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook But it says the data is skewed by early cases and the next batch will look better. It released several new sets of tracing data, covering the first 10 days of the current outbreak, along with a long-awaited report into progress on improving the country's contact tracing system. The new data showed that the several targets for getting people with Covid - and their contacts - into isolation or quarantine quickly fell well short of being fast enough. One target called for 80 percent of contacts to be in isolation within four days of a case's first symptoms, but that was only at 37 percent. Director of public health Caroline McElnay said the data was skewed by the very start of the outbreak, so by the time people were found to have Covid, they had already been infected for several days. It did show contact tracing teams were exceeding the gold standard in the time taken find an infected person's contacts - 80 percent of contacts in 48 hours. That meant those contacts could get into isolation and get tested, lessening their chance of spreading the disease. Mathematician and Covid modeller Michael Plank said contact tracing had been made a lot easier because the country was at level 3. Level 2 would put the system under a lot more stress "People start to move around more, they start to have more contact, they're back into their work places... it's a real unknown as to how the contact tracing system will perform in that environment," he said Epidemiologist Nick Wilson said speed was very important when trying to keep an outbreak in check. "Although there has been some good improvements over time, and definitely better than March and April, there is still away to go," he said A report led by Sir Brian Roche into contact tracing that was released yesterday also said the contact tracing system had improved. But it highlighted problems with the fragmented nature of the health system, including public health units often acting independently. It alluded to the confusion surrounding the testing of border workers, saying there needed to be more clarity on the command and control structure of the Covid response. Professor Wilson said while all those points were valid, the report - which was given to the government six weeks ago - was now old and had big gaps. Its scope was too narrow and it should have focused more on technology, he said. The Roche report did acknowledge the need for better tech, warning that the Covid Tracer app would be much less effective when alert levels were low and people became complacent. It said the government should consider smart phone and bluetooth technology for easy tracing. But Professor Wilson said harnessing phone data should be one of the top priorities, rather than the report's focus on problems with the health system which were harder to change. "It just seems crazy that Google and Apple know where I am all the time when I'm a carrying a smart phone but the government is not allowed to know where I am even in a public health emergency where its potentially going to save a lot of lives," he said. The Ministry of Health said it was looking at trialling the Apple and Google systems but it would take time to make it work with the current system. It said the bluetooth CovidCard would be trialled in Rotorua next month. Health Minister Chris Hipkins said the contact tracing system had improved even since Sir Brian's report and different parts of the health system were now working much better together.

Missed the announcement? Watch it here: Earlier this week, National's leader Judith Collins told media the government should have extended the wage subsidy for the four extra days Auckland will be under level 3 restrictions. Today Collins said National will back small business to create jobs and get the economy moving again. She said the policies will also reduce red tape they face and improve access to capital for new and existing small businesses. "The only sustainable way to create new jobs is to reduce barriers, costs and uncertainty for the private sector, and in particular small businesses," Collins said. The party's small business spokesperson Andrew Bayly said businesses are "struggling under the weight of poor regulation and mounting costs". He said a change to employment law and incentives for job creation will help people off unemployment benefits. The review into WorkSafe will "ensure it is focused on delivering a high performance culture, with an emphasis on a collaborative and reasonable approach to health and safety improvement", Bayly said. Proposed changes to the tax system would include lifting the threshold to expense new capital investment from $5000 to $150,000 per asset and increasing the provisional tax threshold to rise from $5000 to $25,000 as well as raising the compulsory GST threshold from $60,000 to $75,000. "National has been very clear, we won't be increasing taxes or introducing any new taxes," Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said. National will also allow businesses to expense an asset once its depreciated value falls below $3000. The party has reaffirmed its previous policies:

Researchers test waste water samples from managed isolation facilities. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas The funding from the Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund will be in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a statement from the prime minister and minister of research, science and innovation. However, the government says it will not disclose details of the funding due to commercial sensitivity which could prevent a potential deal. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the government had been working in many ways to secure a vaccine as soon as it was available. "I've been talking to a range of world leaders about global vaccine development, including Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau and Scott Morrison," Ardern said. "We are working particularly closely with Australia to ensure we are connected to all parts of vaccine development, distribution and use, as well as our Pacific neighbours to elevate their voices," she said. "New Zealanders should rest assured that we are focused on safety, on effectiveness, and access, as well as cost." It comes in addition to the $37 million vaccine strategy from May, "which includes contributing to the global effort, actively working with our Australian neighbours, domestic research, and investing in our own manufacturing capability." Minister of research, science and innovation Megan Woods said the new fund would enable New Zealand to join initiatives such as the COVAX Facility - a global collaboration aimed at accelerating the development, production, and equitable access to Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. "Our approach to obtaining a Covid-19 vaccine is different to how we'd usually operate, but these are extraordinary times that warrant new and innovative approaches being used." Part of the international commitments was to manufacture large amounts, and not just "for the team of five million", she said. "If we were going to secure international licensing agreements ... we needed to be able to manufacture commercial volumes, so depending on the vaccine, BioCell will be able to manufacture up to 100 million doses." Woods said they were already in conversation with a number of vaccine providers. "Governments around the world are using purchasing arrangements to secure supply, and this will be a key mechanism for helping New Zealand to gain access to Covid-19 vaccines. "The Task Force is well-connected with our Australian neighbours, and we are actively working together to get access to a vaccine for our two countries and our Pacific neighbours." She said New Zealand could not run the risk of missing out and "unless we had a proactive approach to this, New Zealand potentially using traditional purchase agreements could end up at the end of the queue, globally". Although, Malaghan Institute director Graham Le Gros said it could be up to two years before a safe vaccine was available. "The brutal truth is that we don't know a lot about the virus and how to make an effective vaccine against it ... we must be patient, we must believe in what we're trying to do here." Associate professor James Ussher, science leader of Vaccine Alliance Aotearoa New Zealand, said at the moment Covid-19 had shown "very little mutation". "Unlike some other viruses like influenza this virus has genetic mechanisms that do reduce the amount of mutation, we will just need to wait and see whether the vaccines require updating."
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/424020/bryce-edwards-jacinda-ardern-s-successful-and-clever-election-date-shift|2020-08-20|By Bryce Edwards * for The Democracy Project. Analysis - Has the election been saved from becoming another victim of Covid-19? Quite possibly. The issue of when to hold the election had come under serious scrutiny due to the increased restrictions and changed focus necessitated by the outbreak of community transmission of Covid-19. There were major problems with how democratic and adequate the electoral process was shaping up to be, with voting day scheduled for a month's time, on 19 September. Photo: RNZ/Vinay Ranchhod By pushing the election out by a month to 17 October, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ensured there is a greater chance of the election process being more democratic. At the same time, she has further enhanced her leadership reputation by avoiding what would have looked like a self-serving attempt to keep to a date that advantaged her own party. This is what I've argued in a column this week for The Guardian, saying public participation and engagement was in serious question, even if electoral authorities had been able to make the mechanics of voting possible in just a few weeks. Without a proper campaign, full debate and consideration of the big political questions might not occur, and voter turnout might even drop below the 69.6 percent recorded a few elections ago. By choosing the "Goldilocks option" of October, instead of Labour's own preference (September) or her opponents' (November), Ardern has "blunted all criticisms, while yielding the least possible ground to opponents." Journalists and other political commentators have pointed out that Ardern had little choice to delay the election, but has nonetheless handled the issue with aplomb. Newsroom political editor Sam Sachdeva says her decision is unsurprising and pragmatic - "the Prime Minister's innate conservatism and instinct for compromise was always likely to win out" - and it would have been a bad look for her to try to continue with a September election given the virus outbreak. Sachdeva also stresses how smart her choice of date is: "It is also shrewd in that it is not quite what New Zealand First wanted (a November 21 election), nor National (some time early next year), nor in all likelihood Ardern herself, taking some of the politics out of it." Herald political editor Audrey Young also argues Ardern's decision is both smart and correct, saying it "would have looked self-serving" not to delay the election, as well as going against her general use of "a precautionary approach" in dealing with the pandemic. Stuff political editor Luke Malpass also endorses the decision: "Ardern has reached a sensible compromise that takes into account both the practical undertaking of an election and, even more importantly, the appearance and reality of fairness. The exercise of democracy has to be fair, and has to be seen to be fair". He points out that every political party appeared to be driven by self-interest with regard to choosing the date, and it "is worth noting that Labour was just as self-interested in initially wanting the date to stay the same, as the other parties were to move it." Newstalk ZB's political editor Barry Soper fully endorses the prime minister's decision, declaring that "The winner was democracy, the right of parties to get out and campaign". But he's clear Ardern had no choice but to delay, despite her own preference: "There was no appetite on the ninth floor of the Beehive to delay this year's election by a month, but the alternative was too ugly for Jacinda Ardern to contemplate, and even worse for the Governor-General Patsy Reedy to have to cope with. The latter could have been forced to answer a knock at the door up at Government House, opening it to Judith Collins and Winston Peters telling her Ardern didn't have the confidence of the House to dissolve Parliament and they were forming a government." Soper believes Ardern is being "either optimistic or naive when she adamantly declared she wouldn't be changing the election date again", and he says it's out of sync with "these unpredictable and dramatically changing times". The Spinoff political editor Justin Giovannetti reported on the decision, emphasising the pressure that had been building on Ardern to go with a delay, and concludes she "has forestalled a brewing political crisis". He points out that New Zealand "is now one of the few countries to delay its national election due to the coronavirus", and outlines that it "is only the fourth postponement of a general election in New Zealand's history" (with the others occurring in 1917, 1934, and 1941). BusinessDesk's Pattrick Smellie says "Ardern has taken the conservative option" in delaying the election for a month, and believes: "The most important part of her statement today is her emphatic statement that she will not move the date again herself". Newspaper editorials have endorsed the prime minister's decision. The New Zealand Herald suggests that, given current circumstances, New Zealanders aren't fully informed of the political options for the election, nor the referendums. It says the campaign has been "severely impacted" by "the ghastly return of the Covid-19 coronavirus", necessitating a delay to voting. The most important impact of the delay, the newspaper says, is that "the extra 28 days offers voters ample time to hear, see and consider the overtures from our political applicants." And although Ardern might have been tempted to stick with an earlier election date, this "may have jarred with the mantra from this government to be kind." But there is now less chance that voting activity will contribute to "further outbreaks stemming from queues at polling stations or contamination at booths." Editorials in Stuff newspapers says Labour's opponents made a good case to delay the election, and the prime minister "showed the right combination of flexibility and backbone by moving the election date a month back" regardless of whether this was out of genuine "social responsibility" or "shrewdness". Opponents might still complain that the date hasn't shifted far enough, but they risk looking "nakedly opportunistic" or "petulant" (especially, National, which has refused to do anything more than "acknowledge" the new date). The newspaper argues that without a delay the "government would surely have faced three years of carping about its legitimacy", and that it's a good thing for their Covid-19 response to be "put to the test for longer than initially planned". According to the ODT, there were good reasons for the government to continue with the September date, but the decision to delay is wise because it lances the possibility of the election's legitimacy being challenged. The newspaper says the prime minister now rightly wants the focus to remain on combating the virus rather than the election, and yet all the political parties will also have a better opportunity to get their policy positions across without compromising the public's health. All political commentators appear to endorse the election date decision, or at least the cleverness of Ardern for making it. Writing in The Herald, National Party-aligned PR professional Matthew Hooton says the announcement "was politically masterful. It is enough of an extension to avoid accusations of unfairness against parties other than Labour, which risked the election looking illegitimate. But it was not Winston Peters and Judith Collins' preferred date of 21 November, which would have made Jacinda Ardern look controlled by her Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition". Newstalk ZB broadcaster Mike Hosking endorses the change of date, and strongly criticises various academics who argued in favour of sticking with a 19 September election, saying "to seriously contemplate, as our political wonks at universities were, simply to carry on as though nothing had happened is to undermine the entire political process, not to mention tradition and simple fairness". Hosking says going with a September election would make New Zealand look terribly undemocratic: "What do you think the world would make of a country where the government's major party launched their campaign, then locked a solid chunk of the country down, made freedom of movement tricky for the rest of it, and had the official Opposition with no launch at all?" Also endorsing Ardern's choice, Kate Hawkesby likewise suggests an earlier election wouldn't be very be democratic: "it would be simply undemocratic to have rushed through what's arguably the most important election of our lifetime. The focus right now, especially for those in Auckland and for business and tourist operators, is not an election but how to survive. On top of that we are voting on two very important referendums and we need to be able to do that fully informed, with time to make considered decisions. And that's before we even get to policy, which has been put on ice announcement wise. How do we vote when we don't even know what the policies are yet?" In my Guardian column, I suggest that the delay is unlikely to have any significant impact on the fortunes of Labour and National, but is instead more likely to affect the minor parties fluctuating around the 5 percent MMP threshold, and that "a shift of a few percentage points is highly possible and could still make a huge difference", especially in terms of coalition partners for Labour. Luke Malpass argues in his column that the extension of the campaign won't make much difference: "It is hard to see that this month's delay will materially change the polling, unless new and significant mistakes and bungles are revealed. The New Zealand electorate tends not to be capricious. If voters trusted government's handling of the issues last week, there is no obvious reason why anyone will have changed their minds." Matthew Hooton argues it's unclear whether National will benefit from the extended campaign: "Ardern has given National just enough time to show they have something exciting to offer - and, equally, just enough time to prove they don't." Similarly, Sam Sachdeva says: "Candidates and parties now have more time to win over the electorate - but they also have time to make mistakes as well, and there is no guarantee of which way they will go." Yet, it could still have a major impact: "Ardern and her ministers will face pointed questions about the border management regime and the oversight of managed isolation and quarantine facilities, given the likelihood the latest outbreak originated from there and the admission that testing had not met Cabinet's expectations. But Collins too will be under pressure: can she find the right note in responding to this crisis, or will she tilt too far towards negativity or the outright conspiracising that her deputy leader Gerry Brownlee displayed last week?" According to Pattrick Smellie, Labour is at risk given the extra four weeks: "That is plenty of time for Labour's stratospheric polling numbers to take a knock, particularly as the expected fourth quarter economic downturn is exacerbated by the knock to confidence and activity caused by the latest lockdown. Firms are already considering fresh redundancies because of the impact of the Auckland lockdown. Extending the wage subsidy should soften the impact, but this second round outbreak has been sobering for the whole country and hits firms already eating deeply into reserves after the first extended lockdown. It is clearer than it was that we will be dealing with this virus for a long time yet, and the consensus on how to deal with it has been shaken. Any further delay to polling represents a huge risk for Labour that its previously unassailable political position will prove difficult to maintain." Mike Hosking is also of the belief that the delay is good for Labour's opponents: "It's good for National, which gets a launch, and a platform to argue alternatives. And it's good for New Zealand First, which gets time to save itself. It was always going to be closer than many of the Labour acolytes thought. But now, with another month and yet more bungles to spin, the tide on a government that's messed it up and failed to deliver is going out." On Labour's situation, Hosking says: "Every day beyond September 19 is a day the government has to explain this current mess. The border breach, the lack of testing, the very reason we are here is because it has failed to deliver what it said it had." In contrast, Kate Hawkesby argues that Labour will benefit from the public voting once the country is out of the current crisis: "I actually think it's in her best interests not to rush the election. The further away it is, the further we are from the horror memory of lockdown, the more freedoms we're enjoying, the happier we are. That all reflects better on the government. If we went to the polls off the back of another lockdown - still grumpy about our lack of freedoms and worried sick about our businesses and bottom lines - we may punish the government for it."

National Party leader Judith Collins (centre) and deputy leader Gerry Brownlee. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone It's been another momentous week as the Covid-19 outbreak brought a halt to party campaigns and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern now has to decide whether to delay the election. National's leader, Judith Collins, wants it put back to at least November or even held off until next year. Here are her reasons: "It is simply unsuitable to expect there to be a fair and just election at a time when the opposition parties and other parties in government are not free to campaign," Collins needs a delay, and if that happens there are clear advantages for National. It was poorly prepared for the election after its leadership fiasco, Labour has a huge lead in the polls and Ardern is a very popular prime minister. All that could change - given time. National would be able to gather its resources, whip its new team into top shape and prepare itself for a fresh campaign. Public confidence in the government's ability to handle Covid-19 could diminish, the economy could take another big hit and Ardern's popularity could be dented. National's ideal scenario would be an election taking place amid economic despair, the prime minister wilting under pressure and her team of five million giving up on her. None of that is happening now. The economy was recovering more quickly than had been expected and if the new outbreak can be contained it will not make a significant difference. *See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19 Another problem for National is that the government is firmly in charge of the pandemic response and Ardern is on television nearly every day. Collins is doing her best to neutralise that and get in on the act, to have some relevance to events. She wants to be consulted on big decisions, and says it's convention for governments to bring in the opposition when an election is close. She refers to the Cabinet Manual to support her argument. Victoria University's Professor of Public Law Dean Knight disagrees with her. "The government has full power to take decisions prior to the election and is under no legal or customary obligation to consult the opposition about major decisions such as Covid-19 alert levels," he said on Nine to Noon. Collins wants health officials to announce alert level changes, not Ardern. That was rejected by Finance Minister Grant Robertson, who said people expected the prime minister to take the lead and run the response. "It comes back to the point that we are still the government, we have an important job to do in making sure we get on top of this outbreak, it is her job to lead the country through this" Robertson said. Green Party co-leader James Shaw believes Collins is motivated by self-interest. "National is relying on the economy getting weaker and so the later the election is, the more likely it is, in their view, that the economy will suffer and that therefore their political fortunes will rise," he said. Shaw thinks the Electoral Commission should be left to decide whether there should be a delay. It has the power to do that, but not for political reasons. A delay would also favour New Zealand First because it would give the party opportunities to lift its poll ratings. Leader Winston Peters suggested a delay when Covid-19 first reached New Zealand but isn't pushing for it now. Health had to come first, he said, and if the election had to be delayed "then so be it". Does Collins' claim that opposition parties cannot campaign stand up? Professor of Communications Claire Robinson doesn't think so. Speaking on RNZ she said voters were not starved of information and the only thing candidates can't do was go around shaking hands with people. Grant Duncan, an associate professor at Massey, doesn't think it should be delayed. "If we can do our grocery shopping under lockdown, we can vote under lockdown too," he said in an article published by Stuff. "It [a delay] only defers uncertainty about public safety at the polls. No one can predict whether one month later, for example, will be more or less safe than the scheduled date." He pointed out that the Electoral Commission had already planned for a safe election, booking in more and larger voting venues to allow for social distancing. Ardern doesn't have much time to decide. The government pushed back the dissolution of Parliament to Monday, and if it goes ahead the election process has officially started. Delay isn't a simple procedure. Jane Patterson explains it in her Power Play and The House looks at the dissolution of Parliament during an interview with the Clerk of the House, David Wilson. While Collins was calling for a delay and making as much noise as she could, her deputy Gerry Brownlee caused an uproar by suggesting the government had withheld information on the latest outbreak. He listed an allegedly suspicious series of events, which included the Director-General of Health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, telling New Zealanders to be prepared for a second wave and to get masks. This is what Brownlee said: "Then you saw the prime minister's visit to a mask factory along with Dr Bloomfield, after 103 days of no community transmission, having a test himself - all very interesting things to happen a matter of hours before there was a notification of the largest residential part of New Zealand going into a level three lockdown." Questioned by journalists, Brownlee said he was "just outlining facts it's an interesting series of facts". Grant Robertson reacted angrily, calling it "ridiculous nonsense". He told Morning Report Brownlee was effectively accusing Bloomfield of being involved in "some kind of collusion or cover-up". James Shaw said Brownlee's comments were "incredibly dangerous" and he was worried that misinformation was being spread at a time when there was susceptibility to conspiracy theories. There was "a real risk" it would undermine public confidence. "You may find that people are less willing to do what it takes to stamp out the virus this time than they were last time." Before the outbreak, Ardern said it was going to be a Covid election. Now the political landscape has shifted again - she didn't know how right she was going to be. *Peter Wilson is a life member of Parliament's press gallery, 22 years as NZPA's political editor and seven as parliamentary bureau chief for NZ Newswire.

Finance minister Grant Robertson. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas The government has released a handful of documents relating to its Covid-19 response decision making. In a Cabinet paper dated 22 June, ministers submitted 149 proposals in total for the July 2020 round of the Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund and to wave three of the government's response. The proposals for wave three of the government's response to Covid-19 covered six areas - business support, energy, housing and urban development, international education, three waters and water. That amounted to more than $23 billion of spending, but the Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund had a remaining balance of $18bn. However, Robertson wanted a fiscal buffer of $15bn, leaving only $3bn left for spending. But on 20 July, the finance minister announced that the government had set aside a buffer of $14bn. It is understood the $1bn change to the buffer was due to other costs that came up during that month, such as vaccination funding and managed isolation facilities spending.

Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Associate Finance Minister James Shaw - who is also Green Party co-leader - yesterday announced the support for Green School New Zealand, as part of the $3 billion set aside for infrastructure in the Covid-19 recovery fund. The move has attracted ire from numerous quarters, including the opposition, school principals, unions, and from within the Greens' own ranks. Responding to reporters at Parliament, Hipkins ducked responsibility, stressing that the money did not come out of the education funding pool. "It wasn't considered through the usual education capital spend route. It was considered as a shovel-ready project." Hipkins deferred questions to the Ministers responsible and noted that the Green Party had advocated "quite strongly" for the funding. "It was one of their wins, if you like, out of the shovel-ready project area," he said. "It's not necessarily a project that I would've prioritised." Green School New Zealand, which opened in February, charges up to $24,000 a year for local students and up to $43,000 a year for international students. The school has about 50 students, half of whom come from overseas. The funding is designed to expand the school's capacity from 120 to 250 students. National Party education spokesperson Nicola Willis said Hipkins' explanation simply did not wash. Green School New Zealand. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin "How was it that James Shaw was able to have his pet project funded - and now we have the Education Minister saying it shouldn't be a priority?" she said. "The government has prioritised it... and it's not good enough to look the other way now." Willis said the funding worked out at about $200,000 per student while public schools were lining up around the country asking for money for construction. "I have already been on the phone to the principal at New Plymouth Boys' High School, and he said to me, 'Nicola, should I just say that I'm going to build a Green Hut? And then would I get the property funding I want?'" Willis said the Labour-led government had long opposed public-private partnerships for building schools and the Greens' own policy was against giving state money to private schools. "Frankly, it's rank hypocrisy," Willis said. The Greens' education policy states: "public funding for private schools should be phased out and transferred to public schools". Meanwhile, Taranaki school principals have asked for the funding decision to be reversed. Taranaki Secondary Schools' Principals' Association chair Martin Chamberlain described the decision as incomprehensible and naive. "We would like a retraction of it because it's clearly a logistical error. The Green School is a privately-owned institution and any benefit coming to it goes into one individual's pocket. "I think they have politically wrong-footed this. Their political ideal connected to green politics, which is laudable of course, that has got in the way of the logic of the other downstream effects and in effect contradicts other government policies." Chamberlain said there was a crying need in state and state-integrated schools for money that could also go into attracting international students, which was what the Green School was about, and for building and repairing facilities. "If we are talking about adding more jobs in our community and bringing in more international students then our schools do that very job and we're taxpayer-funded not-for-profit institutions." Chamberlain said the funding announcement had the effect of devaluing local schools struggling with aged facilities. Writing on Twitter, former Green MP Catherine Delahunty said the party needed to regroup and withdraw their support for the funding. "I cannot support this funding of a private school - whatever colour is in the name," Delahunty tweeted. Delahunty also retweeted comments by other former Green MPs Denise Roche and Mojo Mathers, both of whom said they were "furious". Speaking to RNZ, Shaw said the purpose of the spending was to create jobs and inject money into the economy through infrastructure and construction. "The local council was keen on this project, both because of the near-term gain of 200 jobs, as well as representing a future economic development opportunity in the export education sector." Shaw said infrastructure spending at other schools was being accelerated through another government funding stream. In a tweet, Green School New Zealand principal Stuart MacAlpine described the funding boost as "an extraordinary move by Jacinda's government".

I think they're quite good in economy. I dislike government which gives so many support to people who don't like to work," he said. In the survey, almost two out three (62 percent) ethnic Chinese said they would vote for the National Party. While still enjoying a healthy lead, that support rate is down 9.1 percent from the 2017 version of the same poll. National's loss almost exactly mirrors an equivalent rise in Chinese New Zealanders who now say they like David Seymour's Act Party. An Auckland woman, who didn't want to be named and has been here 20 years, was one of those who has shifted stance. "I was supporting the National before but this year I'll vote for Act. I think Act's policy is as much as what I want. I haven't seen anything from National this year. Also the leader of Act is very a very action[-focused] person." Just one in five (21 percent) would vote for the Labour Party, almost unchanged from three years ago. Long-term supporter Zhang Quan said Labour is doing better in economy, social development, crisis management and race relationships. "Since my first vote in general election in 1999, I voted for Labour Party for six times out of seven and I'll vote for Labour in this coming election," he said. More than half (52.2 percent) of the 1364 people surveyed said they would prefer National Party leader Judith Collins as the Prime Minister. Current leader Jacinda Ardern gets the support of just over a quarter (26.5 percent) of ethnic Chinese, although Ardern has become more popular than in 2017 when just one in five gave her the nod. Senior lecturer at the School of Humanities at Massey University, Dr Sally Liu, says Chinese voters in New Zealand often look to a party which they believe will preserve wealth. "They're better off. They're from the middle class or above middle class, so when they vote, they will vote for a party which can represent their socioeconomic class." She said many Chinese voters also like to see a belief in a firm rule of law. "The Act Party's policy is to enforce harsh law and to give more security to the society." Three quarters (74.7 percent) of the respondents said they are satisfied with the government's response to Covid-19 - but it didn't translate into votes for Labour. Professor Paul Spoonley from Massey University has a theory. "I suspect what's happening is that it's a report card on how well the government has done up to this point but the Chinese voters are thinking about the future and what needs to happen next so that's why they're very focused on things that will stimulate the economy and which will address their concern." He said all parties have done little to canvass the vote of minorities living in New Zealand. "I think one of the things that surprise me a little bit is how little the major political parties are thinking of the immigrant, minority and ethnic vote. I would have expected to see more of a pitch in terms of candidates and policies which address the concerns of these communities." The survey also asked Chinese New Zealanders about the two upcoming referendums and found fairly definite trends. Almost 84 percent say they support the End of Life Choice Act, but just over 82 percent say they are against cannabis legalisation. The survey also shows Chinese voter turnout rate is at 78 percent, largely in line with the national average of 79 percent. Dr Andrew Zhu, director of Trace Research, which conducted the survey, said information from the poll might help political parities shape their future policies. "The purpose of this poll is to encourage Chinese voters to care about their democratic rights and engagement with the upcoming general election and also that could help Chinese perceptions be better understood by wider communities of New Zealand." Data were collected between 3-16 August through email and social media platforms and covers ethnic Chinese who were born in New Zealand and those from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. The margin of error is +/- 2.64 at the 95 percent confidence level.

File image. Photo: Fish & Game New Zealand The legislation passed this month puts controls on farming practices such as winter crop grazing and feedlots and sets stricter limits on nitrogen pollution. The regulations were described by lobby group Federated Farmers as "unworkable". Federated Farmers water spokesperson Chris Allen said: "As drafted many farmers will end up being unable to comply, an outcome we are sure is not the government's intent". He said the changes were a positive step. "There's a couple of very minor changes there, there are a whole lot of other changes that will be required, to allow the document to make sense, for farmers to be able to implement it efficiently, but we are open to a discussion with the minister." Today, minister for agriculture Damien O'Connor announced changes to the winter grazing regulations to make them more practical. Damien O'Connor. Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King "It became apparent that some of the regulations within the freshwater standards - including ones around winter grazing - need to be adjusted, so we've done that. "The regulations on pugging depths around fixed water troughs and gateways weren't practical so we have made some adjustments to make them more realistic." Discrete areas around fixed water troughs and gateways had been exempted. "We've also amended the definition for pugging to provide more clarity," he said. O'Connor said there were still some challenges ahead, but he was confident they would get it right. "Where the regulations are impractical or unclear we will continue to make adjustments." In a Facebook Live video last night, National leader Judith Collins and agriculture spokesperson David Bennett said their party would do away with the regulations, accusing the government of not liking farmers. "So, David, can we tonight promise, because this makes me very angry that these people would do this, that we'll get rid of them," Collins said. "They are gone by lunchtime," Bennett replied. O'Connor said the comment by Bennett was "stupid". "It flies in the face of what most farmers and most New Zealanders want." Labour's David Parker said the comment "gone by lunch" didn't work for Don Brash and would not work now. "They're trying to shore up their base and instead they're evaporating it," he said. Greens co-leader James Shaw said if anything, the regulations didn't go far enough. He said the better part of three years was spent going through the contentious issue because National had failed to address freshwater issues adequately. "National lost the last election in part because they had failed so dramatically on freshwater, if they want to turn back the clock and go back to the old dirty polluting ways of the past that is up to them, but they lost on that basis," he said. The comments were being described as reckless and dangerous by the Green Party's environment spokesperson Eugenie Sage. "The new leadership of the opposition is trying to take their party back decades by saying rules to look after the health of rivers 'would be gone by lunchtime' if they were in power," she said. Sage said the Greens were committed to strengthening the standards to make sure nitrogen limits are based on the best science and that regional councils have enough resources to ensure healthy rivers. "New Zealand's valuable food and fibre exports rely on our clean green reputation internationally, it's important that environmental safeguards are upheld to help maintain that. "The opposition wants to throw out these safeguards, yet have no plan to clean up waterways and stop pollution in urban or rural streams and rivers," she said. Later today National seemed to back-pedal on the comments. When asked for clarification on David Bennett's 'gone by lunchtime' comment National's environment spokesperson Scott Simpson said it was a "colloquial way of putting it." "Essentially, there were nine issues that were passed by regulation and those issues we think need review and in some cases repeal," he said. Simpson was pleased changes to the regulations had been made today. "For there to be literally a further watering down of the water reforms, I think goes to show how out of touch the current government is with farmers in the paddock," he said. He said if National gets elected it would be listening to the farming community, because the current government had stopped engaging with farmers at a practical level.

Green School New Zealand in Taranaki. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin Associate minister of finance James Shaw made the announcement today saying the project will "secure" 200 construction jobs in the region. Shaw said the "shovel-ready" project would enable the Green School to expand its roll from 120 students to 250 a level at which it would contribute $43m each year to the local economy. It would be funded via the $3 billion set aside for infrastructure in the Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund, he said. The Green School, which opened in February, has a focus on sustainability but doesn't come cheap, with enrolment and tuition fees costing up to $40,000 for some full fee paying overseas students. In February it had a roll of 50 students ranging from Year 5 through to Year 13, half of whom were from overseas. Shaw said the school attracted students from all over the world, which brought huge benefits for the local economy and our broader export earnings. "International education was until recently New Zealand's fourth largest export sector. It is obviously going through a very tough time right now as a result of the global Covid-19 pandemic. "This project not only secures 200 jobs in the near term, it also creates additional capacity for the time when people are able to travel more freely, enabling Taranaki to develop a thriving international education opportunity." James Shaw. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas Shaw said the project would create hundreds of quality jobs. "Meaning more people can continue to provide for their families whilst we weather the economic storm of the pandemic crisis. These jobs will provide a good day's pay, doing meaningful work, building a better future for Taranaki. "The support we are providing will help Green School to meet growing demand from parents all over New Zealand, and the rest of the world, wanting to enrol their children. This will mean more families can take the opportunity to put down roots in Taranaki and contribute to the future growth of the region," Shaw said.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas The National Party has been calling for the government to extend the support for the extra four days of Covid-19 restrictions. Finance Minister Grant Robertson told Morning Report there had been significant help for businesses and there needs to be a balance as the government is borrowing every dollar that is being paid out. "We've already had about $108 million go out to about 30,000 businesses. "It would be an entirely different process and different regime if we were to look to try to cover this." "I think the context is important here. We've had 22 weeks worth of payment for some of these affected businesses. "More than half of that - 12-and-a-half weeks if you're in Auckland - has been paid out when the country's been at level 2 or level 1. "We are borrowing every single dollar that we are paying out, and we have delivered 22 weeks of payment... we know it's tough but you do have to look at this in the total level of support." The government had talked about the possibility of tapping into the $14bn it had set aside for the pandemic response if there had been another two-week extension. "We will always keep looking at that." Treasury estimates the Auckland outbreak is costing the country about $500 million a week in lost economic activity. National's Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said the government was not taking responsibility for the economic fallout. He said the cost did not take into account $1.6b in wage subsidies or the impact on jobs and families. "It all comes back ultimately to failures at the border." Robertson said the government took responsibility for its whole response to Covid-19, and that response allowed the economy to be operating in June, July and the beginning of August at a level far ahead of other countries. "We have to keep our borders contained, we are doing our very very best, and I think overall New Zealand, when we look to the rest of the world, has done well in terms of our ability to get the economy going." National Party leader Judith Collins told Morning Report it was not good enough of an excuse for the government to say they could not work out the admin, or to say the extended restrictions only affected two working days. She said the reality for hospitality and retail businesses was that the impact would be for four working days. "We've heard the government say it's too hard for them to work out the admin on it, well if it's that bad let's give it a week. "If the government's only excuse as to why they're not paying those four extra days is because they can't work it out, well I've given them an alternative." Asked where the money would come from if the scheme went beyond the restrictions period, Collins said it would be from the borrowed money. "We have the money available because the government has been borrowing big on this, and we understand like every country in the world that we're having to borrow through this time." Pushing out the scheme would help with only a fraction of the costs businesses were incurring anyway, she said, but it was better than having people unemployed. "We have already heard from the Hospitality Association, and I don't think they're scaremongering where they've said 10 percent of their businesses won't survive this weekend, I actually think that's true. "We'd rather have people in work and for a little bit longer ... than to have them on the dole queue for possibly months, or in some cases longer than that." While businesses were complying with public health measures, it would be unfair to make them pay the price for a "failure at the border", she said. "It is very anti the New Zealand way." Air New Zealand's chief executive Greg Foran said yesterday its fleet could not operate commercially under the current Covid restrictions. He said physical distancing requirements meant they could only sell less than half of the available seats on turboprops and two thirds of the seats on jets. If crews wore PPE and passengers wore masks, Foran said the airline could operate safely without distancing. Robertson said he understood Covid-19 had been a challenge for airlines, but domestic travel had continued under level 2. "Ultimately our response has always been if we can get on top of the virus we can then see the economy operating at a level that sustains New Zealand. "Every airline in the world has been really hit by this." Robertson said the government is committed to being a majority owner of Air New Zealand. The airline has a $900 million facility from the Crown which it has yet to draw on.

Health Select Committee chair Louisa Wall. Photo: RNZ / Johnny Blades National health spokesperson Shane Reti had written - for a second time - to the Health Committee chair asking for it to be reconvened. His initial request was rejected. Reti wanted the Health Committee to call Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield, senior ministry officials, and the Health Minister, to grill them on the Covid-19 response. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said it was logical for the committee to meet to canvass the advice of those people on the alert level decisions taken by Cabinet this week. "Given the economic and health consequences of the Cabinet's decision it is appropriate for the accountability function to be performed while Parliament is sitting," he said. Committee chair and Labour MP Louisa Wall said she was happy for the committee to be reconvened and would invite the minister and Bloomfield to appear. "I have always considered this was a matter for the committee to decide. However, there wasn't previously a majority who wanted the Select Committee to resume," she said. During the March lockdown, an Epidemic Response Committee (ERC) was set up to enable the Opposition to hold officials and the government to account, while Parliament could not run as usual. But this time, when Parliament was reconvened as a result of the election date delay, it was agreed the ERC would not need to be re-established. Instead, the Health Committee, a regular parliamentary committee, will sit next week, with the details to be confirmed by the clerk of the committee.

Photo: Hagen Hopkins The association has delivered a 4000 signature petition to Parliament this afternoon, for MPs to consider adopting the UK's Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Under the scheme, the government foots half of the bill for a meal eaten at a cafe, restaurant or pub from Monday to Wednesday until the end of August, with a limit of 10 or NZ$20. Restaurant Association President Mike Egan said the scheme had wider benefits than just the hospitality sector, "If we are buying food for our customers, then we are buying off farmers and producers, then we are paying our wages and our laundry bills, so the money goes a long way, whereas if they just gave us a grant we would probably just pay our rent just to get through," he said. He said the wage subsidy was not providing enough support. "The wage subsidy is fantastic, but it is all the rest of the costs we have to work out to get through this period." Restaurant Association CEO Marisa Bidois said to date there had been no targeted support for the industry through the pandemic, despite being one of the worst affected. "Our Dine out to Help out initiative will put much needed cash back into the pockets of hospitality businesses that are really struggling whilst also helping Kiwis to get a freshly prepared meal at a discounted price," she said. Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minsiter Kris Faafoi and National's Economic Development spokseperson Todd McClay were there to recieve the petition, with a contactless lunch delivery of curry and rice. McClay said New Zealand's hospitality sector was paying a heavy price for the government's "bungling of the border". "Today's petition is a plea for help from a sector on its knees. "Hospitality, tourism and travel agents have been hit the hardest by the government's border failure and they need more targeted assistance from the government to save businesses, jobs and livelihoods," he said. Faafoi said the intiative was an interesting idea, but the government was not making a committement to adopt it, as it was more focused on the wage subsidy. "That's not to say we won't keep the dialogue open with the likes of the likes of the Hospitiality Asocciation and the Restaurant Association, they are very important sectors to New Zealanders," he said.

Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Kris Faafoi has today admitted a proposal for a second round of funding never made it to Cabinet. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas The government put forward a $50 million lifeline in April for media organisations struggling because of the first Covid-19 lockdown. It included $21m to cut transmission fees for broadcast media for six months, $16m to waive media companies contributions to New Zealand On Air and $11m for "targeted assistance". The package was intended to free up cash for commercial media companies following the drop in advertising revenue that occurred when New Zealand went into alert level four in March. Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Kris Faafoi said at the time more help was needed and a second funding package was in the works. Faafoi has today admitted a proposal never made it to Cabinet. "We had some conversations obviously with our support partners, but... we weren't able to reach consensus," he said. The level of support needed had changed since the lockdown and media companies were doing better than expected, Faafoi said. "In some of the financial reports that are coming out ... some media companies have done better than expected so it's a bit of a balancing exercise to make sure that we support, but also being the good custodians of taxpayers' money," Faafoi said. Faafoi could not guarantee more support would be offered next term, but said Labour's broadcasting policies would be revealed once the election campaign resumed. "There will be a time when we will be able to campaign more freely, we'll be able to speak more openly from a Labour Party position about what we would like to see to ensure that there is support for the media. "We've had extensive conversations about what we think should be done," Faafoi said.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/424364/judith-collins-covid-19-wage-subsidy-should-have-been-extended|2020-08-25|National Party leader Judith Collins says the government should have extended the wage subsidy for the four extra days that the restrictions will be ongoing. Watch Judith Collins and Dr Shane Reti addressing media here: The current restrictions - Auckland at alert level 3, and the rest of the country at level 2 - had been due to lift at midnight Wednesday, but will now carry through to Sunday midnight. The level 2 restrictions for the rest of the country will also remain until settings are reviewed again. From Monday 31 August, masks will also be made mandatory on public transport for alert level 2 and above. Addressing media this morning, Collins said National's health spokesperson Dr Shane Reti has written - for the second time - to the health committee chair asking for it to be reconvened. She said he had requested for the committee to call in front of it Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield, senior officials at the Ministry of Health, and the minister of health, to get clarity on the Covid-19 response, and "particularly what has been characterised by the government ministers as being some sort of disconnection between bot the ministry of health and minister of health." She said Dr Reti had not received a reply to that request, and his initial request was turned down because Labour MPs would not agree to it. Earlier today, Dr Reti said the party believed parts of the Auckland boundary should have been adjusted to allow places like New Zealand Steel in Waiuku to go back to work. He told First Up that Aucklanders deserve more explanation about the ongoing disruption. Discussing the wage subsidy, Collins said the party would support an extension of the scheme for the four extra days that the restrictions will be ongoing. "Given that the wage subsidy is only being paid because in this time around Covid-19 has been allowed to come back into New Zealand, it is certainly at no fault of the hospitality sector or businesses in general, and it is particularly difficult time." The government has ruled out pushing out the two-week Resurgence Wage Subsidy, to match the extension of level 3 conditions in Auckland until 11.59pm on Sunday. She said that would have been the "kindest and most pragmatic" thing to do. She said the wage subsidy was not sustainable in its current form, which was why the border was key to the country economically and for the public to have confidence. "The main thing businesses are wanting from us is to be able to have the borders safe so they can actually have some confidence in their own businesses." On possible cash grants for businesses, National's finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said they were not at the stage where they would support something like that, but the best way to support businesses now was to extend the wage subsidy. "We are very much in the camp that you do need to support business and the wage subsidy seems to be the best way to do that in the first instance and if we continue to have lockdowns then that continues to be a major issue," he said. "If you are telling businesses you cannot trade then you need some sort of support going on." On masks, Collins said the party fully supported the move to make it mandatory on public transport. "We thought that should've been done ages ago, it's a no-brainer in our opinion." Dr Shane Reti said they would be taking the advice on health official on masks and closely following any changes or recommendations. He said the use of masks in school settings was a complex situation and an equity issue too. It was another matter they would be taking advice on from public health officials and the education sector, he said. He said there was a global trend towards more people wearing masks in more situations. He said transport operators between isolation facilities and the border should be wearing PPE. Discussing border security, Collins said the public was paying the price because the government had not been able to secure the border and undertake the testing they called for. "It's very important to understand if we have the border secure and we have it very safe and we have in place the tracking mechanisms around the Covid app and we also have something like a CovidCard or some sort of Bluetooth technology as well and we have the testing, that any incursion through there will be much more quickly found. "We've heard all sorts of theories about how this Covid-19 came into the country, including cool stories, frozen peas and all sorts of ideas, so far the only indication we have is it came through the border through humans." Collins said if they were in power, the virus would not be in the community and would be contained quicker. "The government has not undertaken what anybody would expect would be undertaken, in other words what they promised, we would not do that. "Any mistakes [would be] fronted up, and we're not going to sit there pointing fingers at each other and say 'it's your fault, my fault' ... that is part of ministerial responsibility." Collins said Health Minister Chris Hipkins was essentially a part timer in that role because he had so many other portfolios on hand. She claimed that he had not given Dr Reti a briefing in over a week. "Clearly, they have dropped the ball," Collins said on the Heather Simpson review that was being done. "I've made it very plain that without better advice - the advice that the prime minister has - we have to actually accept that decision she's made because we do not have the advice that she's made that on."

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Jacinda Ardern told Morning Report that it was possible the country and Auckland would drop alert levels with cases still being reported that were linked to the cluster. "Modelling for clusters is quite hard but we've simply looked at our clusters in New Zealand in the past," she said, noting the Bluff wedding cluster which had 98 cases. "The longest tail we had off a cluster in New Zealand was roughly around the 12 or 13-week mark. This one should be a bit different obviously in the way it's being managed, there's variables in all of them but I do expect it will take us some time to see the end." She said this was not a change in strategy and level 2 had provisions for active clusters. "It's when you have cases outside of that cluster and you don't have control around that cluster that that's really problematic. No-one is suggesting for a moment that we would stay in level 3 restrictions until we saw the tail end of it." From here until the extended restrictions in Auckland are due to expire - on Sunday midnight - if there are unlinked cases or outbreaks the government may reconsider its decision on the alert level. "But at this stage, there's nothing to suggest that will be the case," Ardern said. She reiterated her comments in the briefing that the elimination strategy remained, and that did not always necessarily require a full level 4 lockdown every time an outbreak happened. "We did have cases outside of alert level 4 [previously]. The idea that you would keep New Zealand at alert level 4 until you deal with the tail end of the cluster, I haven't heard widely suggested. "What we also continue to aspire to is to do that with the lowest level of restrictions that we safely can. "This happens to be a very particular example of where when we discovered it, it probably had been in circulation for a couple of weeks so we did needed to take stronger measures." Yesterday, eight new community cases were confirmed - all linked to the existing cluster, which now has a total of 101 active cases. But Ardern said the number of cases linked to the cluster that emerged daily would not necessarily have an impact on decisions, because they were often family members or those already identified as being exposed. "That's of less concern than if you see cases just bubbling up and being found through community surveillance." Another factor that was considered in the extension of restrictions was the increased risk to the rest of the country from Auckland, Ardern said. "We know from the cluster modelling that has been done - even though it's highly variable - there's an assumption that roughly a 95 percent chance of a cluster, by the time its discovered, likely having moved to another part of the country," she said, noting the cases that were found Tokoroa. But she also rejected suggestions that the decisions on alert levels took into account politics, saying that they've been based on science and evidence "that the best response for the economy is one that minimises health impacts".

Photo: RNZ / Vinay Ranchhod Auckland is to endure an extra four days of level 3 lockdown - then on Monday the country's biggest city will join the rest of New Zealand at level 2, but with some caveats. Mass gatherings will be restricted to just 10 people in Auckland, with the exception of funerals and tangihanga where 50 will be the limit. And as long as the whole country remains at level 2, face coverings will be mandatory for everyone using public transport, planes, ubers and taxis. Whether or not the public should wear a mask soon will not be a question up for debate. "We're not mandating a singular type of mask, it is a face covering. So as long as people are making efforts to cover their face, we encourage they look up advice on the best forms of that, that would then satisfy that order,'' Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says. *See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19 Catching a bus to work, hopping on a train or grabbing an uber home after a night out will require a face covering from Monday. Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield recommended that rule for level 3 and above but Cabinet went further, mandating it from level 2. "We thought it was definitely worth doing and it was a line call about whether you mandate it or whether you strongly encourage, and Cabinet has gone with the mandating for level 2 and above,'' he says. A man wearing a mask collects takeaways near Auckland's Queen Street. Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook Ardern says the onus will be on drivers to stop those flouting the rules from boarding. "Entry will be mandated at level 2 or above on someone having a face covering,'' she says. And for any vigilantes planning on taking the law into their own hands, Ardern has this message. "I'd just ask other users of public transport to have faith that we will enforce it and that they therefore don't need to." Bloomfield says mandated face coverings could make the difference when it comes to future yo-yoing between alert levels. "If use of masks on public transport at alert level 2, alongside all our other tools, helps us avoid going up to alert level 3, then I think that's a very good idea,'' he says. But those in the industry now tasked with enforcing the rules are not convinced it will be that easy. The executive director of the New Zealand Taxi Federation, John Hart, says maskless passengers could be put in harm's way if drivers refuse to give them a ride home. And, he says some rideshare operators may not care to police their customers. "The structure of the industry as it is now where there are lots of people who come out in the family car and get whatever work they can and they're not responsible to anyone, I think it's highly likely that many of those will simply ignore the law," Hart says. The prime minister says the case for covering up has been made by the community transmission cases in Auckland involving public transport. And while there will not be many exemptions, Bloomfield says children up to the age of 10 are likely to be excluded. ACT Party leader David Seymour is accusing the government of making it up as they go for the most part, but on masks he says the right call has been made. "Clearly our species is under attack from a virus. We need to defend ourselves against it.'' But he says eliminating Covid-19 also needs to be affordable. Ardern is insisting there will not be a supply shortage when it comes to masks and people do not need to rush out and panic-buy. National Party leader Judith Collins says it's about time for the mandating of masks. "Some of us have been wearing masks when sharing cars or anything like that. I think it's really important to have that compulsory and for people to say 'what about the drivers having to deal with it?' Well drivers shouldn't be having their health put at risk," she says. With the Auckland lockdown continuing political leaders will be staying put in Wellington, and Parliament will meet again today and tomorrow. Next Friday it is likely the prime minister will address the public over alert level settings that are due to expire on Sunday 6 September.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/424306/covid-19-auckland-level-3-restrictions-to-continue-to-sunday-night-ardern|2020-08-24|Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced Covid-19 restrictions will continue at their current level until at least 11.59pm on Sunday night. Watch the announcement from 3pm: Masks will also be mandatory from Monday when using public transport at level 2 and above. Announcing Cabinet's decision at 3pm after a meeting today, Ardern says the rest of the country will remain at level 2. The current restrictions - Auckland at alert level 3, and the rest of the country at level 2 - had been due to lift at midnight Wednesday and ministers met this afternoon to review whether community transmission has been contained. Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield briefed Cabinet on cases, trends, progress finding the index case, the spread of the virus and whether there are any cases still not linked to the Auckland cluster. Aucklanders have been divided on the matter, but the city's mayor and businesses supported an ease of restrictions. Ardern says keeping New Zealand at level 2 is important because of regional travel - many people will want to enter and leave Auckland once it moves into level 2. Photo: RNZ / Vinay Ranchhod This comes with risk, she says, with Cabinet "constantly keeping in mind the cost to business, the cost to the Auckland economy". "It's a finely balanced decision, but the right one, I believe." The wage subsidy two-week extension will be kept as is. She says they considered moving the rest of the country to level 1 but it would be hard to police Aucklanders going across the country to attend mass gatherings. Exponential growth in the cluster or cases that aren't able to be linked to the cluster would mean things would change, she says. She says the government is sticking with its "stamp it out" strategy, and acknowledges many would have found it harder this time. "We may not have any choice about whether or not the world is in a global pandemic but we do have choices about how we deal with it." The limits on mass gatherings to 10 and tangihanga and funerals to 50 are only for Auckland, she says. The rest of the country will have the usual level 2 gathering limits. The wage subsidy two-week extension will be kept as is. Adding days to the wage subsidy is not a simple exercise, Ardern says, and keeping it as is allows the money to keep flowing out to people fast. Ardern says people need to check the list of exemptions for travel through Auckland before applying for one, so they do not clog the process for others. She says some people whose reasons for exemption are already on the list are requesting them when they do not need to. Ardern has also announced Cabinet's decision to make masks mandatory on public transport. She says it will apply at level 2 and above, and will come into effect from Monday. Children will not be required to wear masks, but an exact age is being worked on. Taxis and rideshare services like Uber are included in the rule. "We continue to ask everyone on public transport or planes to wear a mask," she says. "They limit the chance for Covid-19, when it is often harder to distance yourself and trace people." She's not worried about the availability of masks but encourages people to explore buying alternatives to single-use masks if they can afford to, or to fashion a mask from things found at home. Photo: RNZ / Vinay Ranchhod She says it's a face covering, and the type of mask used is not being policed. Advice on different types of face coverings will be available online. "This is a commonsense approach to protect everyone's health." She doesn't want to see the public people policing other's use of masks but if someone were to offer another person a mask then that would be a kind thing to do, she says. She says they continue to encourage the use of masks between now and Monday Cabinet was very, very clear on mask use and it was not concerned about people's response to this as New Zealanders are very pragmatic, Ardern says. Beginning her post-Cabinet briefing, Ardern says tomorrow marks 14 days since the reemergence of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities. Cases have emerged over the past 13 days of cases that occured before Auckland went into level 3, she says, and if it were not for level three, the cluster would be much larger. She says more than a quarter of the testing done across the country has been done in the past 13 days. The next several weeks will see more cases, she says, but also thousands of tests and a team in full force to stamp out Covid in New Zealand. New Zealand knows how to bounce back, she says. "We are strong, we have been kind and we are doing really well." Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Ardern says the whole world has been learning and New Zealand has been improving and learning throughout the pandemic. From Friday's data, testing among the Pasifika community was high, she says. Pasifika represent about 20 percent of the testing, well over the percentage of Pasifika represents in the community. "Without those members of our community being willing to be testing, lives would have been lost - particularly to our Pasifika community ... I want to say thank you." The Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says while the Auckland cluster is contained it is our biggest one. She says that means the tail will be long, and the cases will keep coming for a while to come. Today there were eight new cases of Covid-19 in the community, plus a case which arrived from overseas into managed isolation. *See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19

Tukituki MP Lawrence Yule (left) and National transport spokesman Chris Bishop beside State Highway 5, the Napier-Taupo Rd this morning. Photo: RNZ / Tom Kitchin If elected, the party said it would fast-track improvements on the dangerous Napier-Taup road (State Highway 5), four lane part of the Hawke's Bay Expressway and upgrade the Napier-Wairoa Rd (both SH2). National's Transport spokesperson Chris Bishop announced the proposal this morning, alongside Tukituki MP Lawrence Yule and National's Napier candidate Katie Nimon on the edge of SH5 at Eskdale near Napier. The Napier-Taup road has claimed eight lives in the past year. "The Government claims to have made road safety one of its top priorities but says there is no money for major capital works between Napier and Taup," Bishop said. "It's a death trap, described by the Road Transport Forum as a patchwork quilt in terms of potholes and poor seal on the road." Truck driver Antony Alexander speaks to Yule, National candidate for Napier Katie Nimon and Bishop. Photo: RNZ / Tom Kitchin Bishop said National would urgently start resealing the road and begin a business case for capital works such as shoulder widening, road re-alignments, more passing lanes and more median or roadside barriers. National would investigate realignments at Tarawera Hill, Kowaro-Te Haroto, Te Haroto-Windy gap, the Te Pohue curve and the Te Pohue golf course-Mistletoe deviation. The party committed to upgrading the Napier-Wairoa section of State Highway 2, where there has been 21 deaths and 56 serious injuries between 2005 and 2015. Bishop said the road needed more safety barriers, seal widening and improvements to its surface to reduce the risk of head-on crashes. National would also urgently four-lane part of the Hawke's Bay Expressway, between Napier and Hastings. The road between the Links Rd roundabout and Meeanee Rd overbridge near Taradale would be upgraded, believed to be the most congested. This is less than what the party announced at the last election, when it committed to four-laning the entire expressway. Yule said it would look at four-laning the whole expressway in the long term. The $300m would come from the $31 billion transport infrastructure investment package Judith Collins announced last month. About $200m would go towards the Napier-Taup Rd, $35m for the expressway and $65m on the Napier-Wairoa Rd. Transport Minister Phil Twyford said National was "announcing ghost roads". Twyford claimed National had "no funding, no timeframe, and no telling what they will cut to try and pay for it. "One of the legacies of the last government was a road network full of potholes after they flatlined the road maintenance budget. "We are investing $5.5 billion to play catch up and bring the network up to scratch. Because of our funding boost, there will be an increase in resurfacing work over the next five years for Hawke's Bay - including a large resealing and rebuilding programme for SH5. "In the coming months, NZTA will also be supporting a region-wide road safety campaign alongside police and Roadsafe Hawke's Bay, as well as looking at what other safety improvements can be done. There are already safety upgrades being installed under this government on SH2 between Napier and Wairoa, including wider shoulders, rumble strips and safety barriers."

Photo: RNZ / Sarah Robson The issue has been outlined in a list of concerns to The Charities Services by The Gloriavale Leavers Support Trust. Ex-members say those inside don't have free access to the internet or news sources and are told as a collective who to vote for. One former member, who did not want to be named, told RNZ Gloriavale leaders would choose which politicians would come and talk to the community before an election. "They would talk about their policies and what they would do for us then when they left there would be a discussion, but it was usually only a couple of the leaders who would talk," she said. "They would say we like this party because of this policy and that we should all vote for them because it's best if we vote as a collective." The former member said they were even shown voting papers before they went to the polling booth. "They would say tick here and here just in case we forgot the name or what to do when we got there," she said. "I remember being in line waiting to vote and someone in front turned around and asked which person we were voting for." James Harrison who left Gloriavle in 2015 said they didn't have free access to the internet or news sources. "The group of people who go into town for the weekly shopping trip would bring back old newspapers and then some stories would be cut out and be put on the pinboard but everything we would see is censored. "I remember the thought coming into my head wondering if I could get away with voting for a different party than the one they had told us to, but I didn't vote for them because I was too scared I'd be found out." He said Gloriavale say people were free to do what they like but it was not the reality. "Freedom at Gloriavale is a weird thing, when you've been told to act and think a certain way you're whole life you are not going to go against it are you?" Launch of Gloriavale Leavers' Support Trust last year. Photo: RNZ / Logan Church The Gloriavale Leavers Support Trust has given a list of concerns to The Charities Services, who they want to re-investigate the community. Who you vote for is on the list of concerns. John Ready, who was expelled from Gloriavale in 2017, said if you voted against the consensus and were found out, you would become an outcast. "It's easy to control people if they don't know anything, you don't have an opinion because you don't have the knowledge to have one," Ready said. "If you're told to vote for someone or a specific party what do you have to bounce that off when you don't know better." The Electoral Commission said voters cast their vote alone in the voting booth and that secrecy helped ensure they could express their preferences free of outside influence or coercion. Gloriavale have been contacted for comment.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Health Minister Chris Hipkins.

Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield will brief Cabinet on cases, trends, progress finding the index case, the spread of the virus and whether there are any cases still not linked to the Auckland cluster. Moving the country's biggest city to alert level 4 has been ruled out by Ardern and Hipkins, but it's possible travel restrictions in and around Auckland could remain in place. Auckland is in alert level 3 while the rest of the country is in alert level 2. Photo: RNZ / Vinay Ranchhod Cabinet will also consider whether the rest of the country will remain at alert level 2. At her most recent media conference on Friday, Ardern wouldn't rule anything in or out, except to say any changes to alert levels in Auckland would not be on a suburb-by-suburb basis. There was just one new case of Covid-19 reported in the community yesterday, along with two imported cases. Nine people remain in hospital, including three in intensive care. There are 151 people linked to the Auckland cluster who have been moved into the city's quarantine facility. In total there are 96 community transmission cases - 93 of them are linked to the cluster and three, including the Rydges Hotel maintenance worker, remain under investigation. Yesterday, two new travel exemptions in and out of Auckland were announced. People can now transit through Auckland without stopping in order to travel for work. They must show evidence of the purpose of their travel and their departure point and destination, but an exemption is no longer required. Patients who need to travel into Auckland for hospital appointments no longer need an exemption. Minister of Finance Grant Robertson told RNZ Auckland businesses had coped well with the two weeks of restrictions "for the most part''. Minister of Finance Grant Robertson. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "They can manage, we've stepped up with the wage subsidy scheme which means people can get payments for this period of time and businesses while not happy about it are able to manage it. "Clearly the longer things go on the more challenging it will get, particularly for the businesses who either can't operate at all or are operating in a very restricted form. "Bear in mind there are still a large number of businesses operating at close to full capacity during this period." Were there to be an extension to the restrictions then the wage subsidy scheme would be extended. He would not speculate on whether Cabinet might decide to move Auckland down to level 2 but keep travel restrictions in place. "We have an alert level framework that's pretty clear and people can understand. "If there needs to be specific tweaks to that, those are decisions we'll make, but I'm not going to get into speculating on that.'' He said under level 2 campaigning could go ahead and he would expect that to start again in Auckland if it was to move to level 2 on Wednesday. The government's new testing regime at the border will be finalised and rolled out in a fortnight. It comes after it was revealed just 40 percent of those working at quarantine and managed isolation facilities had been tested for Covid-19. Hipkins will gazette a public health order in two weeks, formalising a new regular and ongoing testing regime of border staff. The government instructed the testing of all staff on a regular basis as far back as late June, but it never happened. By the time the new regime is in place it will have been two months since the instruction was first given by Cabinet. While the new regime is finalised, from today all those working at the border will for a second time undergo Covid-19 testing to ensure the virus isn't being spread into the community. Testing at the border was made mandatory earlier this month after community transmission was found in Auckland, prompting level 3 lockdown.

Opinion - National and its leader Judith Collins don't fit very well with the times. Josiah Banbury takes a look at the wider context of this year's general election - especially the way the ideological winds are blowing - and explains why politicians of the right don't have much of chance of electoral success. National Party leader Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas It seems like an eternity ago, but earlier this year it looked as though the upcoming election would be close. National were riding high in the polls and there was a real possibility Labour would be the first one-term government since the third Labour government lost the 1975 election. On 13 February 2020 National were five points clear of Labour in a Colmar Brunton poll. Less than a week before that a Newshub-Reid Research poll showed National holding a slim lead over Labour. Unable to deliver on the rhetoric that propelled them to an unlikely win in 2017, Labour looked vulnerable, despite the popularity of their leader. Then came Covid-19 and everything changed. After the initial Covid-19 lockdown Labour began to dominate the polls. In May 2020 a Newshub-Reid Research poll showed Labour leading by 26 points. Only a few days later that result was confirmed with Labour holding a 30 point lead in a Colmar Brunton poll. Consequently, Simon Bridges' position was deemed untenable and he was replaced by Todd Muller on 22 May. Less than two months later, Muller stepped aside, and Judith Collins became leader of the opposition. It would be an understatement to say Muller failed to impress as leader. In contrast, many people assumed Collins would be a serious challenger to Ardern, but so far Labour has maintained a strong lead over National. Since then, polls have fluctuated, but a pattern has emerged showing Labour holding a comfortable lead. This article puts forward the wider context within which the election is taking place to explain why National has struggled to convince voters and why they are unlikely to win the 2020 election. During a time of crisis politicians and governments experience the 'rally around the flag effect', which results in increased support from the public. It is a common phenomenon and therefore it was not a surprise to see Ardern and Labour gain widespread support soon after Covid-19 arrived in New Zealand. But how long will the rallying effect last for? It is not unusual for the spike in popularity to be brief. For example, YouGov found the approval rating for Boris Johnson in the UK increased from 46 percent in March to 66 percent in April, before falling to 43 percent in June. It is difficult to predict how long Ardern's popularity will hold. However, Ardern has proven to be an effective communicator, she is now trusted throughout the electorate, and she connects with people emotionally. These traits are most likely to be the main reasons why so many voters were drawn towards Ardern. Covid-19 is a frightening prospect. Most people do not know a lot about pandemics, and they are rightfully concerned. Therefore, they are seeking comfort as much as anything. Since the prime minister communicates effectively, is considered trustworthy, and exudes calmness, it is very likely the rally around Ardern effect will last well beyond the election. Additionally, New Zealand is a very outward looking nation. And things don't look great overseas. When New Zealanders vote, the US will still be struggling to get Covid-19 under control, as will the UK. How the US and UK managed Covid-19 was always going to shape the 2020 New Zealand election. When voters judge the performance of Ardern they are not only comparing her to the leader of the National Party. They are also looking overseas towards countries like the US, UK and Australia as points of comparison. Most New Zealanders have friends or family living in places where Covid-19 is still wreaking havoc, or they see reports in the news on a daily basis. As a result, their evaluation of Ardern is extremely positive. It is incredibly difficult for National to gain traction when people compare the New Zealand prime minister with Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. Ardern has not suggested injecting disinfectant as a cure, nor did she visit hospitals and shake the hands of Covid-19 patents. Yes, that is a low bar, but that is where the bar has been set. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern holding a 3D model of Covid-19 while visiting ESR. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas This leaves National in a rather hopeless situation because it is largely beyond their control. National's election chances would have been helped if Trump and Johnson had produced a swift and competent response to the virus. Recently, Trump claimed there was a "big surge" in New Zealand and "we don't want that". The timing of Trump's comment could not have been worse for National; it became headline news the same day Collins attempted to grill Labour in the House for mistakes at the border. In addition to the problems in the US and UK, Australia is currently attempting to control a widespread community outbreak. It becomes very difficult for National to convince voters that Ardern is failing when she is clearly performing far better than the leaders from the countries New Zealanders compare themselves to. Is Judith Collins the kind of leader who can challenge Ardern in this moment? When Collins became leader of National some believed she was a threat to Ardern and Labour. However, during a moment of crisis a hard-nosed politician who is comfortable engaging in the dark arts of politics is more likely to be a liability than an asset. When a crisis, disaster or pandemic occurs people seek a measured response from those in power. They yearn for security and stability, rather than change. If Ardern continues to pacify peoples' concerns by connecting with them emotionally her popularity should hold in the short term. Collins does not possess the traits required to instil a sense of security in voters. In the midst of a pandemic, few voters who recently shifted their support to Labour will be drawn back to National by a bomb-thrower with a history of dirty politics. National's base might be excited by Collins' confrontational approach, but in the current context middle New Zealand is more likely to view that as a risk. We have seen the desire for stability and security unfolding in the US in a unique way. Trump, who should have experienced a bounce in the polls thanks to the "rally around the flag effect" has suffered a dip in popularity because he failed to present himself as a leader with compassion and composure. Consequently, Joe Biden, who is remarkably inept and still capable of losing the election, holds a solid lead, mainly thanks to older voters shifting their preference away from the volatile and untrusted Trump. Obviously, Collins is not a Trump, Ardern is not a Biden, and the New Zealand electorate differs markedly from that in the US, but a similar process is likely to play out in New Zealand this election. Older voters especially, who tend to lean towards National, will be more than comfortable voting for Labour because they have come to trust Ardern in a moment of instability. Collins possesses a number of unique leadership qualities, which at a different time would serve her well, however, during a pandemic Collins is a liability. Why is National not considered to be the party with the economic solutions for this crisis? The argument put forward by National that they should oversee the economic recovery because they are the competent economic managers has not resonated with the public. While it is true National are usually considered by voters to be better at handling the economy, they are also renowned for being the party of personal responsibility, and they have actively promoted themselves as being tough on beneficiaries. Since New Zealand's dominant cultural trait is individualism, promoting a punitive approach to unemployed people is effective when the economy is running relatively smoothly. However, when everyone is aware the global economy could fall off a cliff at any moment, and while there is a temporal shift towards collectivism, a party that pushes rugged individualism becomes unattractive to an increasing number of voters. New Zealanders generally want their government to be distanced but paternalistic. It is a fine balance. Most of the time people will prefer distance, but during a time of crisis it is not a surprise to see people lean towards paternalism. Right now, most people are aware they could lose their job at any moment, so voters want the government to intervene and protect them. Moreover, if we step back and look at which direction the ideological winds are blowing, this election becomes even more difficult for National. Economic liberalism is the weakest it has been in decades. The rise in popularity of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn is evidence that neoliberalism is on the wane, even if they failed to win their respective elections in the US and UK. Their ideas, which are reminiscent of post-WWII social democracy, did not resonate with people during the heady days of economic liberalism throughout the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. We have also seen right-wing parties overseas, such as the Republicans in the US and the Conservatives in the UK, shift from neoliberal globalisation towards a kind of conservative nationalism that aligns with the Paleoconservative tradition. While this shift is yet to occur in New Zealand, we are starting to see signals it might emerge soon. ACT has experienced a rise in the polls, but this is mostly due to disgruntled National voters looking for an alternative, and the party focusing on culture war issues. ACT are struggling as much as ever to build a base of supporters who are drawn to their libertarian economic beliefs. Ideologically, we are living in different times to that which existed a few decades ago, despite neoliberalism remaining intact in the form of a third-way centrist consensus. New Zealand is not about to experience a crumbling of centrism in the foreseeable future, but the ideological winds are swirling in a way that makes it difficult for National to articulate an economic vision based on their neoliberal, global free-market values. Gradually, more and more people are looking for alternatives to the economic status quo, which means fewer people believe extending the neoliberal project is the path out of this economic crisis. Does the recent re-emergence of Covid-19 and extended campaign period provide National with a chance of victory? The answer to that question is probably no. Perhaps Labour's lead will narrow, but it is unlikely to reduce to the point where the election becomes a close contest. It is just as likely the re-emergence of Covid-19 will result in increased support for Ardern and Labour. When New Zealand went into lockdown in March 2020 voters rallied around their leader and government in large numbers. There is little to suggest voters will now shift towards Collins and National. Kiwis will probably support Ardern's swift response, especially in light of what has occurred in comparable countries. Once again, Ardern will be able to present herself to the nation as a leader in control, a leader people can trust, and a leader that provides the calm reassurance people need when chaos is unfolding. An upside for Labour is that once again Covid-19 is the only thing on peoples' minds. This means that any concerns over Labour's lack of policy, which is their weakness, fades into the background. Even if the worst case scenario happens and community transmission spirals out of control, it is unlikely Ardern will lose support in large numbers. Consider the popularity of Scott Morrison in Australia. Widespread community transmission emerged in July, but his popularity has so far held strong through into August. Interestingly, the results of his actions have been a secondary consideration to Australians. All they wanted to see was a leader who looked as though he was doing everything in his power to solve the crisis. This suggests Ardern and Labour will not drop significantly in the polls even when mistakes occur in the lead up to the election. Of course, this is politics - anything can happen, especially with another four weeks added to the campaign. But if the situation worsens most people will continue to have faith in Ardern, at least for the short term, which is all Labour needs to win this election.

Clockwise from top left: Winston Peters, David Seymour, Jacinda Ardern and Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Stuff Jacinda Ardern announced on Monday the election would be held on 17 October, a delay of four weeks. She said she wasn't going to delay it again. Ardern said she had reached out to the leaders of all the parliamentary parties and discussed the situation with them, but the decision had been hers alone and she would have made the same call if she hadn't talked to them. She wanted the election to be "fair and held in a timely manner". Collins said her party would work with the new date. She told Nine to Noon her personal preference was 21 November. Collins had also suggested delaying it until next year, something Ardern said she had never considered. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters welcomed the delay. He said holding it on the original date of 19 September would have been impossible, and now parties would have time to "up their game" and engage with voters. National and NZ First both need to "up their game" and raise their poll ratings before the election. ACT leader David Seymour said the prime minister had made the right decision and 17 October was "the best of a bad set of choices". James Shaw Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon Green Party co-leader James Shaw wasn't happy. He accused National, ACT and NZ First of political blackmail, saying they had wanted the election delayed for their own gain. Shaw said National had been laying the groundwork for the option of not accepting the result if the election had been held on 19 September. Ardern recalled Parliament and it sat on Tuesday. Collins told media that morning she would use question time to prove Ardern had been "entirely wrong" when she said border staff were being regularly tested. Health Minister Chris Hipkins tried to deflect Collins' upcoming attack by making a ministerial statement before questions began. Testing at the border had been too slow which was "disappointing and frustrating", he said. Hipkins admitted that weekly testing at the Jet Park Hotel quarantine facility had covered only 60 percent of staff. Collins went for Ardern, armed with the prime minister's statement of 15 July in which she said all frontline border staff were being regularly tested. She also challenged previous statements by Ardern and Hipkins that some staff had declined to be tested. Ardern responded by saying there was no clear link between the border and the new Auckland cluster. The government had "set expectations" that border testing would be ramped up, she said. Testing in isolation facilities "was not as comprehensive as we expected or what Cabinet had asked for". Ardern kept to the line that the government had issued instructions but despite that, the level of testing had not reached expectations. There was no clear explanation of why the instructions weren't followed. Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the Director-General of Health, was asked at a subsequent briefing why the instructions didn't seem to have got through. He gave the familiar reply that there had been complexities and difficulties with co-ordination. Bloomfield has also referred to there being a "dissonance", apparently between the government and his ministry. Bloomfield was asked during the week whether he had misled the prime minister about the level of testing, and he said he had not. Ardern said it would be unfair to blame him. National wants to find out exactly what happened. It has asked for the health select committee to be recalled so it can question Bloomfield. On the same day Parliament resumed sitting it was revealed that a maintenance worker at the Rydges Hotel managed isolation facility in Auckland had tested positive. Genome testing had linked his case to the same strain of the virus found in a woman who had stayed at the hotel between 28 July and 31 July after she returned from the United States. Hipkins described the case as "a bit of a mystery" and by the end of the week it had not been determined how the worker had caught the virus. The man had not had any direct contact with the woman, but it was discovered he went into a lift minutes after she left it. The possibility that the man caught the virus from an infected surface in the lift was being investigated. The Minister responsible for managed isolation facilities, Megan Woods, held a media briefing and said the case was not linked to any incident, system failure or the Auckland cluster. The worker had not been in the woman's room while she occupied it or after she left. There was no third person who could have linked the two. Hipkins said the man developed symptoms on 11 August, was tested on 13 August and his results were returned on 16 August. The case drew fresh criticism of the testing regime and protection measures in general. "Infection beggars belief" said the New Zealand Herald's headline over a report that asked: "who knows how many people he might have infected - and how many they might have infected - if he hadn't been tested." The report ran through a litany of incorrect assurances about testing. "Why is there - still - a giant chasm between what the government says is happening and what the ministry is doing?" it asked. Megan Woods and Chris Hipkins have faced some tough questions this week over the government's handling of testing at the border and within quarantine facilities. Photo: RNZ During the week the government responded to the new outbreak by announcing it was rolling out CCTV at managed isolation facilities and boosting the number of Defence Force staff at those facilities so it didn't have to rely on private security firms. "Our intention is to stop using private security contractors, particularly in the riskiest places," Woods said. Her announcement followed the revelation that a First Security guard at an Auckland facility had been suspended after releasing the personal information of 27 returnees and five staff members on Snapchat over the weekend. On Thursday National announced its own Covid-19 response plan with stronger measures than those currently operating. It's the sort of policy Collins is good at selling. "This is tough, but tough times need tough measures," she said. National would set up a new border agency reporting to a single minister, with the mandate of keeping New Zealand free of Covid-19 and other pandemic threats. Collins said the government's response involved putting various agencies in charge of different facets, which had led to "a disordered and confused response". "More than 1.6 million Aucklanders are locked down because the government dropped the ball on testing, tracing and managing people in isolation," she said. Under National's plan returnees would be blocked from boarding a plane if they did not test negative three days beforehand. When they arrived they would still have to go into 14 days' of managed isolation. "If you have a positive test you won't be boarding a plane to New Zealand," said health spokesman Shane Reti. Asked if that would create legal problems because citizens could be prevented from returning their own countries, he replied that they were not being prohibited. "We're saying if you want to come back and you want New Zealand to be safe, then these are the regulations you'll need to respond to." Collins is relying on having public sentiment behind her. "Issues like this are always a balance and I would say New Zealanders would want us to keep Covid-19 out," she said.

Hipkins said people could spend days in transit and become infected at airports. He didn't think another layer of bureaucracy in the form of a border agency would be much help. Stuff reported that in many countries, including the United States, the testing turnaround time was longer than three or four days. If National ever did put the restriction in place it would probably be challenged in court, but Collins is saying what a lot of people, particularly Aucklanders, want to hear right now. *Peter Wilson is a life member of Parliament's press gallery, 22 years as NZPA's political editor and seven as parliamentary bureau chief for NZ Newswire.

Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers The case at the Auckland Rydges Hotel has proved a mystery, as tests showed the worker and woman who had returned from the US are the only two people in the country with the same unique strain of the virus, but are not believed to have had direct contact. Experts believe the man contracted the virus after the woman, and the case has raised questions over transmission via surface contact or through a third unidentified carrier. Speaking to Checkpoint this evening, Minister of Health Chris Hipkins said it wasnow thought the virus may have been passed on when the two were in the same lift at separate times, but minutes apart, on 28 July. He said in some cases it may not be possible for workers and those in isolation to have designated separate lifts, but this would be considered as part of investigations into how the transmission occurred. Whether the man and woman each wore masks in the lift was also still to be checked. He said the possibility the virus was picked up in the empty lift doesn't necessarily challenge the ministry's definition of what a 'close contact' to a case is. Close contacts of someone who tested positive for the virus are prioritised for testing, while 'casual contacts' are only tested if they display symptoms of the virus. Hipkins said, at the moment, there was not enough testing capacity to test all casual contacts, though more testing could be considered if testing technology developedso more tests could be carried out faster. "You still have to work on a risk- based framework. One of the things we say to casual contacts is that they are at a heightened risk, so you should be much more aware of your symptoms. "We wouldn't necessarily test everyone who was on a plane with a positive case, but we would test everyone who was sitting near them. And we would tell everybody who was on that plane to please keep an eye out and make sure that if you exhibit any symptoms that you get a test. "There's still some element of risk there, because they may still touch the same surfaces, and things like that. We've never said there's no risk for casual contacts, that's the reason why we identify them." Asked whether this case meant practices and risk definitions need to be updated, he said practices and protocols were constantly being adapted as more was learned about the virus here and overseas, but details about this case were still being sought. "The investigation's still ongoing, and it may well be linked back to the main cluster. We reveal what we know at the time, we've made that commitment, and at the moment there's still a lot of questions around that case." Hipkins said the Auckland cluster strain, called B111, seems to act differently to the most widespread strain that was in the country earlier this year. "The B111 does seem to be reasonably infectious, in that people show symptoms reasonably soon after exposure to it. "So that differs a bit to some of the ones we were dealing with earlier on, where there was often quite a gap there." When viruses produce symptoms earlier in the infectious period it can help those carrying them to take action to get diagnosed and isolate themselves earlier, which can help slow transmission. A decision about when Auckland students can return to school is expected to be made early next week, and the government expectedto give schools and families some warning ahead of the chosen date, Hipkins said. "That [decision's] more likely to be on Monday after we've made the decision about what's happening with Auckland." Hipkins said he was seeking more information about unrest over executive team resignations, a mounting budget deficit and staff protestsat Canterbury DHB. He plans to speak with DHB chief executive David Meates, and its board chair Sir John Hansen soon, but would not be drawn over whether government intervention into the situation was needed.

(File image). Photo: 123RF Because the election day has been changed, the Electoral Commission has offered more leeway for party spending. Potential costs increased to $1.199m in the two months from 18 August and 16 October. The previous spending limit was $1.169m over three months, from 19 June until 18 September. The commission says the spend includes the "preparation and placement" of advertisements,. It means parties will not be able to take advantage of an increased spend over a shorter length of time. Broadcast advertising is now allowed to start on 13 September, ending at midnight on the eve of the election. Third parties campaigning on the two referendums are also allowed to spend more. Their budgets are increased to $338,000 - a $8000 increase. Third Parties had been calling for clarity around what they were allowed to spend on referendum campaigning, saying it could have a big impact on results.

Sixteen-year-olds in countries like Austria and Scotland vote in higher numbers than other young people, a New Zealand teen says. Photo: 123RF The members of Make It Sixteen, a youth-led campaign, will have their case heard on Monday. They say the current voting age of 18 is unjustified age discrimination and it must be changed. Ella Flavell who is a member of Make It Sixteen told Morning Report the case raised an important principle. "We believe that this can bring change to New Zealand so that we can have a much more representative democracy and a stronger democracy so we're hoping this will give Parliament the precedent to change." The outcome of the High Court case would not impact on the October election, however, either way it would be useful to have some precedent to work with. The recent Supreme Court case involving prisoner voting rights had provided a good precedent for Parliament to make changes to the legislation, Flavell said. She was confident 16 year olds would exercise the right to vote if they were allowed. "Countries that have currently lowered the voting age, including Austria and Scotland, have seen that 16 year olds actually voted more than those in their twenties when they were allowed to do so." She agreed the climate change issue was a driver for younger teenagers becoming more involved in politics. As well, a lot of 16 year olds were in a more supportive environment whereas older teens were often in a "more chaotic" environment as they left school and started work. Flavell supported civics education at school so young people could gain an understanding of how Parliament and government worked.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/424089/referendum-campaigners-look-for-clarity-after-election-date-change|2020-08-21|Referendum campaigners are urgently seeking clarification on how they can proceed with the election date moved back by a month. The election date has been moved back a month to October 17. Photo: RNZ/Vinay Ranchhod Registered campaigners can only spend $330,000 in the three months before the election, and say they now need clarity about how that might change. They also need the chance to talk to voters face-to-face, they say, or risk failing to get their message across. "All third party promoters can only spend about $320,000 in the three months prior to the vote," Drug Foundation executive director Ross Bell said. "So does that mean that we have to spread that out over four months now? That's unclear." The foundation is seeking a yes vote in the cannabis referendum, saying the legalisation of recreational cannabis use would reduce harm on the whole.  He said the delay has caused plenty of headaches. "We're still trying to get our head around what it all means," Bell said. "Fundamentally, it's an extra month which comes with, you know, an extra month of unplanned expenses, so there's a hit to the budget that we have to figure out. "Some real basic problems [we have] , like we had just got all of our posters and brochures, delivered with September date. So we have to reprint all of those things." Aaron Ironside, who leads the Say Nope to Dope campaign, said both sides of the cannabis debate are impacted by the delay. Ironside said legalisation would cause a high level of harm to the community, and says getting those facts across will be more difficult than ever. "We're just not sure that people truly understand what the issues are," Ironside said. "We think it will be harder for us to clarify for people that we're not talking about medicinal cannabis, we're only talking about recreational usage. "And I think the actual details of the proposed legislation will escape most people who will be focused in other areas and unlikely to encounter the truth." Ironside said the referendum could move out of the spotlight, and the cancelation of live events has a big impact. Henoch Kloosterboer, who leads the Vote Safe campaign opposing the end of life bill, welcomed the delay. He said it will give people more time to understand the legislation in question, which is particularly important given the nature of the referendum. People will be deciding whether to enact a full piece of legislation that has been through the parliamentary process, not a theoretical law change, as he describes the cannabis referendum. "No one really wants to be making sort of life and death decisions on the End of Life Choice Act, whilst grappling with the stresses and pressures of Covid-19," Kloosterboer said. "Vote Safe's campaign is really around creating public information and public awareness around the End of Life Choice Act and I think more time will always aid that conversation." Linda Kennington of Yes to Compassion supports the legislation, and said she isn't worried about the extension. She does not think it will affect the vote at all. "It's been a long time coming, you know, many, many years," she said. "The legislation was passed last year with a majority 69 percent. The polls have always been around that level, public polls around 70 percent. "We're just keeping on telling people about it so that they've got the facts and we're just looking forward to October 17." Government officials are working to offer clarity to campaigners around financial restrictions.

Cabinet ministers are meeting today to review the current Covid-19 alert level settings. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will update the public at a 1pm news conference alongside Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield. One week ago, Ardern confirmed Auckland would stay at alert level 3 and the rest of the country at level 2 until at least the end of Wednesday, 26 August. At the time, she described the move as a "short but precautionary hold" which Cabinet would review on 21 August. Speaking yesterday, Health Minister Chris Hipkins said ministers would consider the most up-to-date information from the recent "surge of testing" and contact tracing. "There's not an exhaustive hard-and-fast set of rules here. It ultimately comes down to judgements." New Zealand yesterday recorded five new cases of Covid-19, bringing the size of the cluster to 78. Another two cases remain under investigation. Hipkins declined to say when the public should expect an announcement on whether restrictions would be eased. "We do - when we make those decisions - rely on information right up to the hour before we sit down as a Cabinet." Bloomfield told reporters he would advise ministers on whether he was confident officials had been able to "draw the net tightly" around the outbreak to contain it. "The level of testing that's been done outside of Auckland will also give us a very good picture about whether there has been spread beyond Auckland." ACT Party leader David Seymour yesterday told RNZ the latest test results indicated the lockdown should be relaxed next week. "It would be absurd to keep Auckland at level 3 for another week, unless there's more outbreaks and heaven forbid that." Hipkins is also expected to issue an order under the Covid-19 Public Health Response Act on Friday, setting out the expected testing frequency for border workers. Last Friday, the government made testing of staff in isolation hotels mandatory after revelations only 40 percent of staff in isolation hotels had been tested. Since then, almost the entire workforce has been swabbed.

Our own election delay of a month may or may not avoid it taking place during a lockdown of some degree. But even if thats the case, other countries have successfully conducted voting. Singapore's general election last month will be remembered for masked voting queues, polling officials in protective gear, trouble with gloves, and inroads by the opposition. New Zealand journalist, Jamin Jamieson, who works for Rice Media and haslived in Singapore for eight years says it was dubbed a social media election. "There was a huge surge in traffic towards opposition (parties online) pages as if that was mimicking the rallies that were previous held by the opposition. They got far more free air time ... their videos went more viral, that kind of thing," Jamieson says. Singaporeans were already living under strict pandemic rules when the prime minister Lee Hsien Loon announced the election would go ahead on 10 July. Mask wearing was mandatory, gatherings restricted to five people, the country had just emerged from lockdown. So come election day, voters knew what to do. "Every voter was given a two-hour slot that they were asked to come and cast their vote within," says Reuters Singapore bureau chief John Geddie. "It was to try and avoid there being huge long lines at polling stations." The elderly were encouraged to come in the morning, everyone else was allocated an afternoon slot, people with special needs or disabilities voted last. Every voter's temperature was taken and by law everyone wore a mask. New Zealand journalist Jamin Jamieson describes seeing polling booth officials in "post-apocalyptic PPE gear". Everything was running smoothly until midmorning. "So you had to go to the polling station then take your identification card, lower your mask to show who you were, then put it back up, then you were given rubber gloves for handling the ballot paper," says Geddie. But that's when things went awry. Geddie tells The Detail's Sharon Brettkelly how the well-planned election day didn't go as expected, forcing officials to make last ditch changes and keep polling booths open for longer. For Jamin the build-up to the election, the nine-day campaign, was markedly different to previous election rallies when stadiums filled with tens of thousands of voters. "Its like a social occasion going out with the family to a public rally, its quite fun," he says. This time voters briefly met the candidates in "walkabouts" and "door-knocking" but the rest of the campaigning was on screen. It made stars of some interesting characters, including the 80-year-old candidate who attracted tens of thousands of Instagram followers with his "hypebeast" messages. "This is the kind of thing where if he had to do a rally it would be very different," Jamieson says. "It wouldn't have those kind of playful antics." But it will be remembered for more than being a pandemic election.It shook up Singapore's democracy, shook up the ruling PAP or People's Action Party and for the first time the main opposition the Workers Party got official recognition as the opposition.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/424069/warnings-of-election-disaster-if-postal-votes-not-properly-handled|2020-08-21|A potentially huge increase in postal voting has prompted warnings a failure to properly prepare could lead to an election disaster. There are fears of an electoral crisis if the number of postal votes outstrips the ability of government agencies to handle them. Photo: 123RF Postal votes could potentially explode and number in the hundreds of thousands because of Covid-19 if the elderly and those vulnerable because of health conditions cannot physically go to public polling booths. There are fears of an electoral crisis if the number of postal votes outstrips the ability of government agencies to handle them. There are acknowledged risks around both the capacity to deal with a flood of postal votes and the security of posting a ballot, rather than voting at a polling booth. Justice Minister Andrew Little says the Electoral Commission is preparing for postal voting to play a "much bigger role than has been in the past". Rough estimates for last election were 10,000 to 15,000 but now they're preparing for up to 750,000; the "estimate of potentially vulnerable people". There is a heightened risk, he concedes, "once you significantly expand the postal voting option", that was weighed up against "making sure that people had a sense of safety when they were casting their vote". And in a situation where the virus could make more people feel unsafe about going to a polling booth, Little says he "trusts the advice of the Electoral Commission on the steps they take to reduce that, to minimise that." The 750,000 figure covers the people whose voting may be affected during a lockdown; for example the elderly and those with health conditions. If there was a regional lockdown those numbers would change accordingly, depending on where it was. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters says he became "seriously concerned" about postal voting after the 2018 census: "Everybody knows it was an absolute disaster at both the online level and the postal level... now, we're contemplating that around an election, you can see the potential disaster we face." New Zealand First leader Winston Peters. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas A major problem, he says, was votes not being processed quickly enough by NZ Post to make it on time to become a valid vote, deficiencies New Zealand cannot afford to have repeated in a general election. And that was before Covid-19, says Peters, which creates even more alarming challenges - concerns he raised in his 14 August letter to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urging her to delay the original 19 September election date. "The potential for change that's generated by a fear of leaving your home, forced to go to the postal system, and then realising how many and how few post boxes there are," he told RNZ, "which means that they will be lining up at the central post offices and again the contact and the spread will be a great danger to them," and could just lead to people deciding not to vote. A confidential August briefing paper Effect of Covid-19 on the delivery of a General Election, from the Electoral Commission to Little, says there are "capacity limits to the number of postal votes the Commission can process" as voters may be "less willing to go to a voting place or even use a post box". It concludes that "may decrease voter turnout". National Party leader Judith Collins agrees there's a risk of "a deluge of votes" coming in by post, "either late or just not even being processed". "The Electoral Commission, I think, is trying to deal with a lot of moving parts," she says, "because they don't know quite what the situation the country's going to be in". Chief Electoral Officer Alicia Wright says the August advice about capacity limits was based on holding an election under complete lockdown and where postal voting would need to be rolled out to all voters. They are preparing for postal votes in the "tens of thousands", peaking at 380,000, but could scale up if necessary. Wright also says they're looking at ways to encourage people to use different options; for example they'll be offering those in rest homes a "takeaway" vote, where someone comes and collects their ballot paper. Collins says her concerns are around the ability of NZ Post to get the ballot papers delivered quickly, as it "doesn't deliver nearly as frequently as it used to, and doesn't expect to get mail delivered from one end of the country to another as quickly as it used to... so there are real issues with that". Wright says ballot papers posted will be treated separately to the rest of the mail, "in such a way that they are identified and we can move them through in a way that keeps them secure". Little says the rules around verifying a registered voter have been relaxed to make it easier to use postal voting. Someone in their own home would still need a witness, he says, but those in managed isolation or quarantine facilities would not. Little says concerns about postal voting have been flagged in recent months and Cabinet has responded, but in the end it's up to the Electoral Commission "to run the election in a way that has integrity and that is critical, and we provided the regulatory change and the budget to enable them to do that". Minister of justice Andrew Little. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "But we go on the advice and the advice is that in order to maximise turnout in these sorts of conditions, then this is something they need to have up their sleeve," he says. He acknowledges the increased risks around security of voting by post rather than by ballot box, but assures voters that has been addressed: "We've been well advised about that and have taken steps to mitigate any risk around all of that. "In the end, I'm totally confident that the Electoral Commission is focused on running an election that maximises turnout and has full public confidence." NZ Post chief executive David Walsh declined an interview but in a statement says they're "working closely" with the Electoral Commission, including how it will work if some or all of the country is in lockdown. He says currently postal voting is just for those "vulnerable" voters, and NZ Post is not set up for "mass" postal voting. Voters who may need to use a postal or a special vote are encouraged to register in plenty of time, explore options like "takeaway" votes as an alternative, and if using the post make sure to send it off leaving plenty of time before election day. Peters brushes off the suggestion he's worried about postal voting as it has the potential to impact an important voting base for New Zealand First - the elderly. "One could take that narrow view," he says, "but one has to have the bigger view, and that is the quality of our democracy. "This is far bigger than one political party ... the first duty of a Member of Parliament is just that, that we are here as Members of Parliament before we are members of political parties." In the United States President Donald Trump has stoked fears about the risk of electoral fraud posed by postal voting - prompting accusations he's trying to undermine the election. Little says concerns about postal voting here were well traversed by Cabinet and MPs have certain responsibilities when talking about the election: "We all want our general election to be credible and and for people to have confidence in it and for it to have integrity. "For those who are involved in making decisions, particularly in the regulations, covering our elections, it's incumbent on us to speak in a way that maintains public confidence in our electoral process." Collins says her concerns are about practical considerations and not about laying the groundwork to later question the legitimacy of the outcome of the election. "They're concerns the Electoral Commission's heard so many times... every message I'm giving is if people need to postal vote, they need to contact the Electoral Commission early on." She says National is "happy to accept" the election result, but warns Electoral Commission has a tough job ahead.

Genomic testing has also been undertaken for an additional case still under investigation of a man who visited St Lukes mall on 12 August. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visited the Crown research institute, ESR in Porirua yesterday, where she thanked staff. "I've read more than one of your reports and the insights that they provide us, particularly as we go through this period of resurgence. "The insights that you'll be able to provide us to help us with our cluster management and control in solving some of the mysteries that present themselves has just been really critical," she said. Jacinda Ardern with ESR chief executive Peter Lennox. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas ESR strategy director Lisa Oakley showed Ardern the data that had been compiled at the response centre, including figures that showed the number of cases per 1000 of the population from different countries. "And if you need to reply to Donald Trump, this is a really good way of saying we're probably in quite a good space," Dr Oakley said jokingly. The prime minister then went on a tour of the wastewater testing and genome sequencing areas, before having a private meeting with some of the scientists. ESR's head of bioinformatics, Joep de Ligt, said among the discussions Ardern asked about being able to streamline genome sequencing. Dr de Ligt said work has already been done alongside Massey University to speed up the testing. "We originally started the whole protocol being something like 12 hours, they brought that back down to that sort of nine-hour work time, which means that we have then also learned from that and adapted our procedures, so we can receive those samples on an evening or morning and by the end of the day have those results back." He said early on there was also an investment in equipment that allows users to view data, while the machine is still sequencing. "That means for some of the genomes like the Rydges case, we were looking [at the data] at eight in the evening, half an hour later we had enough data to make a first analysis," he said.

"Some things that might seem mundane, but they all factor into those turnaround times, those are the kinds of things that she [Ardern] was looking at if there was anything the government could do to make that better." Another tool being investigated by scientists is the testing of wastewater for surveillance of the virus. A research project is already underway at the Jet Park Hotel, with the hope it could eventually be expanded to indicate further outbreaks in the future. Dr Oakley said environmental surveillance was quite common for viruses like polio. "It is kind of adapting from that and [our] drugs in wastewater work under the forensics contract for example, so it is really using our established technologies to transfer into something new," she said. Dr de Ligt said there are still questions to be answered about how diluted the sample can be for the virus to be detected. "Can you detect the virus if it is in one in a thousand people, or can you only detect the virus if it is one in 10 people?" Researchers test waste water samples from managed isolation facilities. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas ESR chief executive Peter Lennox said other organisations around the world are doing similar work with wastewater testing. "At the moment it is indicative, so there might be something there, we are trying to get that precision higher and higher, so that it is something that will be useful for us in the future. "But it is not a silver bullet at the moment for determining if we have coronavirus throughout New Zealand," he said.

Act Party Leader David Seymour and deputy Brooke van Velden. Photo: RNZ / Craig McCulloch Party leader David Seymour announced the Covid-19 policy at Parliament this afternoon, saying New Zealand should model itself on Taiwan. In Taiwan, new arrivals can quarantine at hotels, Airbnbs, or a private home, but are electronically monitored and face steep penalties for breaches. Seymour said that approach was far superior to New Zealand's "prohibitively expensive and overly disruptive" strategy which required people to stay in a government-run hotel for 14 days. "The government's job is to set clear rules of the game for isolation, and if you break those rules, then you can finish your 14 days in Mount Eden [prison]," he said. "And I don't mean the nice new remand centre - I mean the old one they closed 30 years ago." People could be monitored using GPS on smartphones, as in Taiwan, Seymour said. Rule-breakers would be subject to fines "well into the thousands", as well as the threat of imprisonment. New arrivals would be risk-assessed based on their circumstance or the country they were coming from. For example, people with criminal records or deported gang members would continue to be housed in a government-run facility. "At the moment, if you are a rail tunnel engineer coming to work on the City Rail Link you get treated the same as a 501 [deportee]," Seymour said. "I don't think that makes sense." People would "absolutely" still be subject to the current requirement to be tested twice during the 14-day period, Seymour told reporters. Asked how that would be facilitated, he said people were already being tested all over the country, but initially certain areas could be stipulated. ACT did not want to abandon the Covid-19 elimination strategy, but to explore ways to make it more affordable, Seymour said. It wants a "Central Epidemic Command Centre" to be set up and tasked with "maintaining elimination while maximising overall wellbeing". Seymour said its first task would be to improve contact tracing to such a standard that lockdowns - like the current one in Auckland - were not required to contain an outbreak. "We've got to get a lot smarter than just telling everyone to go home and put a teddy bear in the window for five weeks every time there's an outbreak." That would involve the use of more advanced technology, such as the CovidCard currently being trialled in Rotorua, and temperature testing at airports, Seymour said.

The cameras that currently exist in hotels don't cover areas that are now being used for things like exercise. "Managed isolation and quarantine facilities are commercial hotels with security systems that support the hotel function but there is room to improve these systems to better protect our communities from Covid-19," Woods said in a statement. She says the thermal CCTV will cost an estimated $6 million. The Minister in charge of isolation and quarantine, Megan Woods. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone The government is also looking at adding CCTV in public and exercise areas to monitor distance breaches, CCTV in accommodation corridors to monitor any breaches between rooms, a Security Control Room/Desk, audible alarms on fire exits, and electronic access systems to restrict or track movement around a facility. Woods says the new measures will enable quick response to any breaches. "It will also enable better evidence collection to support enforcement action and if necessary police prosecution for non-compliance. "Keeping Covid-19 at the border is a priority for the government and these security enhancements are another tool in our toolbox to ensure returnees stay in the facilities and limit risk to the community. "While no system is fool proof these additional security arrangements add an extra layer of protection to help keep Covid at the border." She says the government respects individuals' privacy and there will be no additional survelliance in private rooms. The announcement of new measures comes a day after the government bolstered Defence Force numbers at isolation and quarantine facilities. It has also set up a new team of health advisers, after the Health Ministry failed to deliver a robust testing strategy at the pace required.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423842/smaller-east-coast-parties-struggling-to-campaign-under-covid-19|2020-08-18|This national election cycle has been more challenging than most and candidates from smaller, grassroots style parties are struggling to make their voices heard. Photo: 123RF Covid-19 has thrown face-to-face campaigning out the window and many local debate events have been cancelled, which leads to tough times for candidates from smaller parties as they fight to make themselves visible without the resources and platform of a large party. East Coast New Conservative and Act candidates Helena Nickerson and Blake Webb said they had faced issues campaigning under level 2. Nickerson said people had been reluctant to receive pamphlets from volunteers for fear of Covid-19, and Webb said the elderly, in particular, were nervous about face-to-face contact outside their extended bubble. Nickerson said smaller parties like hers could struggle to get the same attention from media as the larger ones and couldn't afford large campaigns, therefore they were more reliant on face-to-face campaigning as well as social media. "Covid-19 has had a profound impact on our campaign; we do not have a platform through radio or television, so we are reliant on connecting with people face-to-face and delivering flyers," she said. "You have to deliver flyers very cautiously because some people have high anxiety about Covid-19, and they don't want you to put things in their letterbox that they have to handle. "Social media at the moment is our biggest way of getting the word out there." Nickerson said social media had connected her team with volunteers who were happy to help by delivering pamphlets and putting up hoardings across the district. Webb said his campaign had been affected by Covid-19 because he did a lot of his campaigning face-to-face and had been hoping to attend some public meetings, some of which had now been cancelled. Those that had not were now subject to strict capacity rules. He does not have a large online presence like some other candidates through which to campaign. "All I've been trying to do is raise awareness of Act's policies and where we stand to raise our party vote," Webb said. "If it's affecting my ability to campaign in level 2, it's definitely affecting candidates in Auckland in level 3." Webb visits local businesses and door knocks when he is not at work or with his young family and said he had found some people, especially elderly, were reluctant to speak face-to-face for fear of the virus. "They don't want to talk to anyone face to face outside of their extended bubble," he said. However, both candidates agree that the delayed election has given them a slight reprieve with more time to campaign and gather momentum. The election date has been pushed back four weeks from its original September date to 17 October. "For small parties that are struggling it does give us time to get the word out," Nickerson said. Webb said the election date needed to be delayed to ensure a "free and fair" election. "People in Auckland are on house arrest so there's no way we could justify starting the voting process in these current restrictions," he said. Advance New Zealand candidate Jennie Brown has also welcomed the later election as it allows her to campaign for longer. She said she was on the "back foot" compared to other candidates and the later date would place candidates on a more even footing. Brown was originally a candidate for the Outdoors Party before switching to the New Zealand Public Party, which then merged with Advance NZ. "The delayed election gives us more time to share our concerns with the public, and more time to put up our billboards," she said. "I think anyone who opposes the current government is happy we have more time to campaign." Brown said Covid-19 had not affected her campaign although she was making sure she followed all the level 2 rules. "Under level 2 it hasn't made much of a difference for us, level 3 might be a different story," she said. "It didn't stop us getting out on Sunday [at Heipipi Park in Gisborne] and speaking to the public about our concerns in regard to Covid-19." Brown said if debate organisers were still happy to hold their events under level 2, she would attend. Green candidate Meredith Akuhata-Brown has had the added challenge of vocal surgery, which rendered her voiceless for a week, however, she is most concerned about whether the election date change will discourage some voters. She said she had worked hard in her last three terms as a Gisborne district councillor to get people more engaged with local democracy. "So, my initial concern with the postponement was the impact it might have on those people who are less likely to vote anyway; whether it will act as another pushback to them," she said. "But this is about a health issue and I think our prime minister has shown leadership to ensure the safety and wellness of our nation is at the forefront." Akuhata-Brown said the impact of Covid-19 on the election could be managed by candidates who could promote the need to vote. "We need to be pushing for people not to be afraid, to ensure people do have the support they need so they do vote," she said. "I challenge anyone who is standing in this election to make sure their message is, how important it is for everyone to vote. Messaging needs to be prolonged, pronounced and less ego-centric this time round. Hold your candidates and parties you are voting for to account." Akuhata-Brown said it was important any new government had the support of New Zealand as there were challenging times ahead. As for her campaign, Akuhata-Brown feels secure in the knowledge that most people in the Gisborne side of the East Coast electorate know her and what she stands for because of the years she has spent on local council. She has also been utilising social media to connect with a broad range of people in the electorate. Akuhata-Brown said she has been invited to speak at several meetings across the electorate and expects that, if these went ahead, they would be to a much smaller crowd. "You need to make an impact regardless, because those people will speak to their friends. If I can captivate that small group, never underestimate their power to make change," she said. "I will be making the most of any opportunity to travel to the Bay of Plenty." National candidate Tania Tapsell was contacted for this story but said all questions should be put to National leader Judith Collins. Labour candidate Kiri Allan was also contacted but did not respond in time for publication.

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/421726/winston-peters-friends-went-to-antarctica-on-taxpayer|2020-07-22|Foreign Minister Winston Peters directed Antarctica New Zealand to give two highly-prized spots on a trip to the icy continent to two women closely linked to one of South East Asia's richest families. Winston Peters is the minister responsible for Antarctica. Photo: RNZ/Vinay Ranchhod Bee Lin Chew and her daughter Su Arn Kwek, who are dual Malaysian-New Zealand citizens, travelled to Scott Base, at taxpayer expense, in February after Antarctica New Zealand scrambled to make room for them at the insistence of Peters' office. Emails released under the Official Information Act show Antarctica New Zealand pushing back at the request to include Chew and Kwek, as only one spot was available and that was supposed to be for a government minister. Tax payer-funded Antarctica New Zealand initially warned that science programmes or essential staff may have to be cut to make room for the women. But it ultimately managed to fulfill the request without disruption to the programme and in line with the "firmly held" views from Peters' office. In an interview on the doorstep of one of the two homes she owns on Auckland's exclusive Paritai Drive, Bee Lin Chew said she was a good friend of Peters and his partner Jan Trotman. Chew said she had met Peters, the leader of NZ First, through his old friend Philip Burdon, who served "for a very long time" on the board of one of her family's companies. National MP Gerry Brownlee, who has been pursuing the issue through Parliamentary written questions, questioned why Peters nominated a friend for the prized trip without any obvious benefit to New Zealand. In 2018, NZ First MP Shane Jones was critical of then-Antarctica New Zealand board member Rob Fyfe after his wife Sara Tetro travelled to the continent as a consultant. "Explain to me why one of the directors of the board of Antarctica has been allowed to take his wife down when ordinary Kiwis never get the chance to go to Antarctica," Jones said to RNZ. Broad daylight late in the evening walking the pressure ridges outside Scott Base @antarctica.nz #AntarticaNZ #ScottBase A post shared by Sara Fyfe (@sara_mail) on Nov 19, 2016 at 6:31pm PST Emails released under the Official Information Act show Peters, who is the minister responsible for Antarctica New Zealand, planned to invite Finance Minister Grant Robertson to the ice in light of the redevelopment of Scott Base, which the government committed $18.5 million to in 2019. Robertson could not go, so Peters nominated Chew and Kwek. Their visit to the continent was described by Antarctica New Zealand as occurring "on direction from the Minister of Foreign Affairs". Jana Newman, manager of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Antarctic unit, emailed her colleagues on 14 January about the visit after speaking to Antarctica New Zealand CEO Sarah Williamson. Newman said Antarctica New Zealand told her it "only ever held one seat for this season" for a ministerial visit and she was not sure where the idea of two seats had come from. "If there were direction that there needed to be two seats made available, existing, planned, prioritised and funded events, likely Antarctic science, would need to be cut from the programme." After speaking to Peters' office, Newman wrote to Williamson saying the foreign minister and his chief of staff were working on the understanding two visitors could go. "We are not sure where the understanding came from but it is there and firmly held," Newman wrote. "It would be helpful for them to understand the material effect on the programme, if two people were to travel, before they go back to the Minister - are you able to provide that information - i.e. what would need to be cut and what the impact would be?" Williamson responded saying she had gone back through six months of records and there had only ever been one seat and bed for this type of visit and that space was needed for engineering and maintenance staff at Scott Base before the temperatures dropped. "As all the flights are full any reallocation of seats on the 5th February will require a reallocation across other flights on other days and on some flights there are very few seats allocated to the New Zealand operation". Emails between foreign affairs and Antarctica New Zealand officials show they eventually found a solution which would not cause disruption to the programme and the pair would visit the ice between 7 and 10 February. Williamson emailed the board of Antarctica New Zealand on 28 January saying that as a result of Peters' direction she would endeavour to make travel for Chew and Kwek work. "As Antarctica New Zealand has been directed to host the invited visitors to Antarctica by the Minister's office we will ensure that the team provide the best experience they can." Chew, who is listed on the electoral roll as a 'housewife' but is also a director and shareholder in a food and a real estate company in New Zealand, told RNZ she was a "good friend" of Peters. She said that while she did not make political donations she did "wine and dine" with people with political power, including National Party President Peter Goodfellow and also with Peters and his partner Jan Trotman. She said she had not donated to New Zealand First or to the New Zealand First Foundation. "I make an effort not to contribute. So no matter how much they would like to dig amongst the funds they will not see any donations from me to either party," she said. "Because I don't really do business here I don't actually need any of them to help me in any way." She said Peters knew about her passion for travel and the outdoors. "I have travelled to South America. I was about to go to Nepal and Mt Everest before the lockdown. So I am very much into the world of nature. So he would so know what I enjoy - both him and the wife." When the opportunity came up, "I said, 'sure, without doubt I will jump on that.'" Scott Base Photo: RNZ / Alison Ballance Chew said she got to know Peters through his friend Philip Burdon, who was a National Party MP alongside him between 1981 and 1996. "Philip served on our board for a very long time," she said. Burdon was a director of GGL Assets, a subsidiary of Guoco Group, ultimately owned by Hong Leong Company of Malaysia, one of the largest conglomerates in South East Asia. In December 2018 Guoco Group Limited was given Overseas Investment Office approval to buy Pacific Health Group TopCo1 Limited, the second largest mnuka honey company in New Zealand, for $269 million. Burdon was named as one of the people with "control of the relevant overseas person". Burdon said he knew the family through his business dealings but had nothing to do with Chew and Kwek travelling to Antarctica and didn't know about the trip until contacted by RNZ. While on the ice, and hearing from Antarctica New Zealand that private money would also be needed to develop Scott Base, Chew said she wondered whether Peters was motivated to send her on the trip in the hope she would contribute funding to the project. But she says she was never asked for money. Deputy National Party leader Gerry Brownlee said he did not accept the idea of the pair being possible contributors to the Scott Base redevelopment as being a valid reason for them to travel to Antarctica. He said if there was a campaign to get private money for Scott Base then the government should be upfront about that. "You'd expect it to be a very widespread programme that a lot of New Zealanders could consider putting money into or people from overseas but it must be transparent." Information RNZ received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade about why the two were invited is partially redacted, but says "they are fascinated by Antarctica and the role NZ plays there" and "have no connection to any government's interests". Peters refused a request for an interview. In response to Parliamentary Questions from Brownlee, he said he had met Chew and Kwek "many times, strictly in a personal capacity", after being introduced to them by Burdon and former National MP Sir Don McKinnon. Asked by Brownlee why he nominated the women for the trip, Peters said they "had a keen interest" in Antarctica and were "interested in the government's broader objectives" there. A summary of the trip, released by Antarctica New Zealand to RNZ, shows the pair visited Cape Evans and Cape Royds to see Shackleton and Scott's historic huts and toured McMurdo station and Scott Base. Antarctica New Zealand is seeking to distance itself from the visit and is refusing interviews. Chief executive Sarah Williamson emailed her board on 28 January saying: "All future requests for information from outside Antarctica New Zealand in regards to the trip will be redirected to MFAT as Antarctica New Zealand is not in a position to answer these." Board minutes from February show that Antarctica New Zealand is now implementing a new policy for international visitors. The minutes say that the policy should now "include the benefit of the visit to New Zealand/Antarctica New Zealand". Antarctica New Zealand told RNZ that the new policy was planned regardless of Chew and Kwek's visit.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423980/judith-collins-unveils-national-s-border-security-policy|2020-08-20|National Party leader Judith Collins is unveiling the party's policy on border security. Watch the media conference here: The National Party wants to establish a Border Protection Agency to oversee and manage Covid-19 and any other public health threats at the border. Collins has likened the agency to korowai, describing it as a cloak of protection. The agency would be called Te Korowai Whakamaru. The announcement comes a day after the government bolstered Defence Force numbers at isolation and quarantine facilities. It's also set up a new team of health advisers, after the Health Ministry failed to deliver a robust testing strategy at the pace required. Collins says the current Covid-19 border approach was set up in an ad-hoc way and heightened border management will be required. She says National wants international travellers to provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before entering the country. It also wants those who work at the border and treat or test Covid-19 patients to carry compulsory contact tracing technology. This would include the rapid deployment of bluetooth applications and things like a CovidCard. The agency would report to a single minister whose focus will be keeping New Zealand free from the risks of Covid-19 and other pandemic threats. It would also oversee the response from other agencies such as the Ministry of Health and district health boards, and be responsible for managing co-payment for the costs of managed isolation. Anyone in contact with people in managed isolation would be required to have a weekly Covid-19 test and all agency workers would be required to carry contact tracing technology. Collins says the government has dropped the ball on testing, tracing and managing people in isolation. To prevent the virus coming through the border National wants international travellers to undergo pre-boarding thermal imaging and completion of a health declaration card. It would also require another test of travellers within three days of arrival as well as a test on day 12. Collins says New Zealand borders will be tough, but they will be smart. "This is tough but tough times need tough measures." Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Targets would also be introduced for testing, with a plan to make waiting times for a Covid-19 test no longer than 60 minutes. Aged care workers would be required to undergo regular testing and more opportunities would be created for wider testing within retirement homes. Collins says the current response of putting various agencies in charge of different facets, "has led to a disorderly and confused response, putting the health and livelihoods of five million New Zealanders at risk". "More than 1.6 million Aucklanders are locked down right now because the government dropped the ball on testing, tracing and managing people in isolation. It's not good enough." Collins says if there's a need for a lockdown it would be based on what's necessary. "We have a zero tolerance to Covid-19 being in our community." National says returning New Zealanders would be blocked from entering the country if they returned a positive result in a new test everyone would have to have, three days before arriving here. Under its new border policy, National would "require international travellers to provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before arriving in New Zealand". Health spokesperson Shane Reti says a National government would "follow international models and require people coming into the country to not only quarantine but also test themselves for Covid-19 three days before departure, and provide the results of that test to airline staff before boarding their plane". "If you have a positive test you won't be boarding a plane to New Zealand," he told reporters at the policy launch. Asked if that would create legal problems by preventing citizens returning to their own country, Reti says they are "not prohibiting them from coming back, we're saying if you want to come back and you want New Zealand to be safe, then these are the regulations you'll need to respond to". It's "very clear", says Collins, with the whole country under some level of restriction, "issues like this are always a balance and I would say New Zealanders would want us to keep Covid-19 out." New Zealand has seen what happens when a "less rigorous approach is taken - we're not prepared to allow that to happen", she says. National's Covid-19 border response spokesperson Gerry Brownlee says a Crown Agency dedicated to defencing New Zealand from the virus would be established within National's first 100 days in government. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "This agency will be resourced to act as a centre of expertise. It will have the personnel, technology and capability to provide a world-class defence against Covid-19. "National will immediately invest and seek to rapidly deploy bluetooth technologies to enhance contract tracing, making these mandatory for border facility workers and District Health Board staff who treat or test patients,'' Brownlee says. "Continuous improvement of our systems is required so that lockdowns become more targeted and effective, with minimal impact on our communities and the economy."

National Party leader Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone It comes after New Zealand First announced its proposal to set up a new Border Protection Force. As the Labour-led government comes under pressure for the recent border oversights, other parties are keen to demonstrate how they could do a better job. National's policy is expected to also include a single overarching agency to manage the border - but without the military focus. It's understood to be more in line with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. New Zealand First MP Ron Mark told Morning Report that his party's Border Protection Force proposal made logistical and economic sense and believes it would be more effective than the current system being used by the government. "We [the military] have facilities that's under-utilised... when you look at the money being poured into these hotels we could have built infrastructure with a lot of that money and put up secure facilities which people would not have liked to escape from because of their location." Mark said he had numerous conversations with his Cabinet colleagues about using Waiouru and places with an airstrip like Wigram in Christchurch. He said those locations could have done with an injection in capital to improve facilities and put wired fencing around them to discourage people from leaving. "The one thing the military is good at is quickly building facilities, but we'd need a hand to do that," he said. Mark said the reason the government has stalled in its success of controlling the virus is because all of government taskforce under-utilised the military. Speaking as the Minister of Defence, Mark said soldiers will bring more authority to quarantine facilities, which security guards have lacked. More Defence Force staff are being rolled out at isolation facilities in response to a number of quarantine bungles. Soldiers have no power to detain or arrest people who try to escape facilities, but Mark said they have soft power and will ensure the facilities are running safely. "There are those of us that said right at the outset that we would need this level of rigour, discipline and control of our personnel," Mark said. "People who were experienced, mature, who had been in difficult situations are used to handling civilian people with empathy and responsibly, a little bit of wisdom and maturity to be able to assess situations and know how to handle people without using force." He said he's had reports from police of people mingling in managed isolation with people they shouldn't be mixing with and getting drunk and doing "bizarre" things. When it came to powers of enforcement, that will be left to police, Mark said. "The police will always be present on site. "Those people who chose to behave in an uncivilised manner ... there will be a police officer there that will arrest them, cuff them and take them to a cell."

Photo: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly Leader Winston Peters has released the party's new quarantine policy, saying pandemics offer "no room for error". He says the events of the past week have raised the question of whether the current arrangement of government agencies is the best way to fight outbreaks. "This is not a criticism of the valiant efforts of our frontline staff and emergency workers," Peters says, "this is a call by my party for a new border security policy ... a new Border Protection Force. "A new centralised force to focus our government efforts in a single line of attack." He says the "roles, responsibilities, and obligations" of the border force would be clearly set out; "patchwork responses and blurred responsibilities must be rejected". It would combine the functions of the Defence Force, Customs and other border agencies. Another major change would be handing responsibility for quarantining over to the Defence Force, with the option of using Waiouru, hakea or Burnham Camps, with assistance from police. Peters says this will all provide longer term options, and potentially avoid having to put large cities like Auckland back into lockdown. He says it will significantly reduce the cost to taxpayers. "The current costs of quarantine to government are astronomical, a fraction would instead be invested into the set-up and the running of military facilities." Pandemics move swiftly, he says. "They offer no room for error, and a government must be at its very best to beat a pandemic. "This nation has responded well in the past, but we must examine every option and take every step to respond better in the future."

Health Minister Chris Hipkins. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Following the positive case of the hotel maintenance worker, health officials are being urged to use serology testing which could reveal if a person has had the disease even if they haven't had a positive Covid test. Health Minister Chris Hipkins said serology tests were used but not routinely. He told Morning Report it had been used for the Auckland cluster but wasn't sure if the test had been used for the Rydges Hotel maintenance worker. "We use it where it can help us to slot new pieces into the puzzle." He said the government didn't yet have a good understanding of how the hotel maintenance worker caught Covid-19. "It remains a bit of a mystery." At this stage, he couldn't rule anything out - "surface transfer certainly possible", he said adding that an investigation was still ongoing. So far tests of all coworkers, close contacts, family and household have returned negative results, Hipkins said. "That's promising ... we got that one early enough that it hasn't been passed on or if it has been passed on, it won't spread further because we've isolated all the people that person could have potentially passed it on to." He said the workmates would be tested again, but a decision on testing the household members again was yet to be made. "We'll be making sure there's no risk of any of those contacts passing it on to someone else if they've picked that up." He said everyone at the facility was being tested, and if there was a spread, it would have almost certainly showed up in testing results. "This is the system as it should operate." Hipkins ruled out Auckland moving to alert level 4. That's because there was no spread at the Rydges Hotel, and though there was an unidentified spread of the 'Auckland August cluster', the government was trying to get ahead of it. He said level 3 restrictions were helping get to the bottom of the cluster. However, National Party leader Judith Collins would not say if Auckland should stay in level 3 or not. Covid-19 border controls were front and centre yesterday in the first sitting of Parliament since the postponement of the election. Collins told Morning Report not testing all border staff was "a massive failure" for the government. "I'm not going to blame [Director-General of Health] Dr [Ashley] Bloomfield." National Party leader Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers Collins said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern should take responsibility, first for letting David Clark stay on as health minister for three months, and then appointing Chris Hipkins - who already holds several portfolios - as the new minister. "The buck stops at the top and it stops with her. She's responsible, she needs to explain it. "You don't as prime minister put out a press release on 23 June saying we're testing frontline staff at the border and then find out eight weeks later ... the public finds out that was not true." Collins said there should be mandatory testing for border staff. "Once every two weeks is better." She said National health spokesperson Shane Reti had advised her that about 30 percent of tests could return false negative results, which is why she said frequent testing was necessary. "It's not just about testing, it's also about contact tracing." She said the government's NZ Covid Tracer was not working competently and only 6 percent of the population was currently using it. "We will be putting out our policy in relation to this," she said. By 1pm yesterday afternoon, Bloomfield said nearly 1.5 million people, or 37 percent of the population, had downloaded the app. Collins said people risked losing their jobs after a "total and systemic failure at the border". "What I believe is that when Covid-19 comes in through the border that we have to have a system in place that immediately can find out where this has gone."

National Party leader Judith Collins and deputy Gerry Brownlee. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas Parliament was adjourned for the election in early August after a week of often emotional and bitter parting shots from retiring politicians and when coalition relations were being stretched to the limit. It was with a sense of relief parties abandoned the hothouse of Parliament and fanned out across the country to start campaigning - only for it all be brought to a screeching halt by the Auckland outbreak. Auckland-based MPs have been asked to stay put, and only party leaders and senior ministers and spokespeople will be back for the two or three weeks Parliament will now sit. Campaigning has been put on hold until closer to the new election date - October 17. This will be a bare bones parliamentary session though with only question time and time for specific debates and ministerial statements. There won't be any select committee hearings or legislation progressed - unless the need for an urgent law change arises. The Opposition is lining up to challenge the government over its Covid-19 response, with National's leader Judith Collins accusing the government of misleading the public about the inconsistent testing of border workers, despite promises all staff would be tested regularly. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield denied any failure, saying testing had been scaled up and you couldn't just "flick a switch" and and begin testing everyone immediately. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said she was not looking to apportion blame, but the government had expected rolling out testing of staff, including those who were asymptomatic, and that did not happen. "What appears to have been the case is that it was tending not to necessarily have that level of coverage," she said. "I have had reported reluctance amongst staff around asymptomatic testing." But Collins has cited border staff who have been in contact with National challenging the comments some had refused testing as untrue, with others saying they did ask for tests but were refused as they were asymptomatic. "And that is entirely different from what the government has told us for the last two months," Collins told reporters. But the Opposition's focus has already been waylaid, with deputy Gerry Brownlee forced to defend a fundraising email sent to supporters last night in which he appeals for help to beat Labour, in the face of "endless wall to wall coverage, the deep resources of government, and a favourable media". He said it was a fact a government "does get more air-time" in a crisis like National did after the Christchurch earthquakes, and denied trying to undermine the media, during an exchange with journalists at Parliament this morning. "You're being very precious," Brownlee said when reporters pressed the point. "It's the context of there being a lot of coverage of what the government is doing at the moment... and so they do get perceived in a more favourable way." He "totally rejected" any suggestion he was a "conspiracy theorist". Last week, Brownlee caused a stir after posing several questions about the actions of government ministers and Bloomfield in the run-up to the announcement of the Auckland outbreak. "All very interesting things to happen a matter of hours before there was a notification of the largest residential part of New Zealand going into level 3 lockdown," he said at a media conference. When asked what he was implying, he said he was "just outlining facts ... it's an interesting series of facts". Collins was forced to defend her deputy against accusations he'd indulged in floating unfounded conspiracy theories in a series of interviews in the days following. Today Brownlee said his questions were reasonable given the responses on border controls and quarantine ministers had made to the House, but acknowledged his comments were "unfortunate". "I'm very upset," he told reporters, "I'm sorry that people have taken it as being a some kind of conspiracy accusation. It was never meant to be like that."

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas The government made it mandatory for all frontline border staff to be tested for the coronavirus following the revelation that by early August some two-thirds have never been tested. Jacinda Ardern says the government had instructed that there would be rolling testing of staff including those without symptoms. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield yesterday said there had been no testing failure at the border regarding Covid-19 and nor had he misled the government on the issue. Ardern told Morning Report the government asked for and was provided with a testing strategy from the Ministry of Health at the end of June which included rolling testing of border facing staff without symptoms. Ardern said mobile testing units were set up at Auckland Airport on 10 July and 16 July. "Clearly our view was that that would be quite wide testing, including asymptomatic. "What appears to have been the case is that it was tending not to necessarily have that level of coverage. "I have had reported reluctance amongst staff around asymptomatic testing. "Our expectation was we would have asymptomatic rolling testing ... it was what we had instructed." Ardern said it was also the Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield's expectation. "I don't feel I'm a position to pinpoint or make any claims about what exactly has been the issue with that testing regime at this point. "What I'm looking for is the final outcome. "I'm not interested in the whys and wherefores, what I'm interested in is that every single frontline border staff member is routinely tested and is compelled to be on a routine basis." Ardern said Bloomfield and Air Commodore Darryn Webb, head of managed isolation and quarantine, retain her confidence despite the border testing shortfall. The majority of front line workers have now been tested, as have most lower risk aviation staff, with 2000 swabs been taken at Auckland Airport, she said. No issue of shortage of medical staff to do testing had been raised with her. She said even a weekly testing regime is not foolproof and other, existing, parts of the strategy including daily health checks and PPE use were important.

File image. Photo: 123RF With the election date pushed out to 17 October, sitting MPs get to keep being paid - for the extra time. The move has been greeted with a positive response, from both other political parties, and voters themselves. For prospective candidates, there was also a widespread acknowledgement it was the right thing to do. But while for the sitting MPs it means four more weeks of paid work, for those hoping to take their seats this time around there's no such security. When Steph Lewis - Labour's candidate for Whanganui - found out about the delay, while she had no doubt it was the right decision, it did bring with it some anxiety. Before she threw her hat in the ring she was working as a senior privacy advisor in the public sector. "I have taken leave from work, and I have checked my bank balance this morning and crunched some numbers, since the prime minister's announcement," she said. Financially, she'll be fine, although it may take some personal sacrifices. "I may perhaps not buy quite so many cups of teas and what not at cafes, but I will be fine. I am yet to have a conversation with my boss about extending my leave." She is just one of the hundreds of candidates who are hoping to take their place in one of the 120 parliamentary seats on offer. New Zealand First candidate Jackie Farrelly, standing in the West Coast Tasman electorate, said she was blessed with a good boss. "I'm a part-time rural postie and courier, and I have an amazing boss, just so flexible, she's just 'whatever, take whatever days off you need', and 'I'll work on these days and you can work on those days', so it's easy. "And we're essential workers so it hasn't changed my hours per week." Then there's the question of campaigning. The Electoral Commission said it will be up to the parties to decide when and how they want to resume campaigning. Rawiri Waititi works in the rnanga of Te Whanau a Apanui. The former Labour MP is standing for the Mori Party in the Waiariki electorate, but he said for him, the campaigning has never stopped. "In Moridom, you don't overtly campaign, what you do is just carry on doing the mahi for your people, because that's what you must do. "If that means it looks like campaigning to everyone else, well so be it, but the protection of our whakapapa is the most important thing, and we must continue to do that, and to look after our people." Now with an even longer build-up to election day, candidates are having to pace themselves. Green Party candidate for the Auckland electorate of Maungakiekie, Ricardo Menndez March, said the priority for his team of volunteers was maintaining their wellbeing. "Elections have always felt like a bit of a marathon, but obviously this election is under very exceptional circumstances, so my priority is actually that my team are not burnt out." With his team all currently under the alert level 3 lockdown, they were currently just looking after themselves, before they tried to implement some lockdown-suitable campaign methods, he said. One benefit to the election being extended is being identified by the New Conservative candidate for New Plymouth, Murray Chong. "What it does is it spreads my time out, so I can actually talk to more people, because it's so important people learn the policies, rather than the personality politics." One thing the date change does mean is TV and radio ads will be postponed to 13 September - when the Governor-General is due to issue the writ for the election to be held. The National Party's candidates were not allowed to speak to RNZ on this story.

New Zealand parliament. Photo: RNZ / Alexander Robertson The 2020 general election has been pushed back four weeks to October 17, which means politicians will reconvene in the House for general debate and question time. Just when they thought it was all over, the 52nd Parliament is back. "It's a bit like you've played a great game of rugby through to the final whistle and then the ref blows the whistle for another 10 minutes each-way of extra time and I guess you've just gotta love the game and keep playing," Act's leader David Seymour said. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's decision to delay the election by four weeks because of the Covid-19 outbreak in Auckland means opposition parties are on the spot to question the government. "I consider it important that Parliament is able to consider the decisions of government and that these decisions are still subject to appropriate scrutiny," Ardern said. Seymour, who is an Auckland-based MP, had planned to be out campaigning in his Epsom electorate and across the country. He has instead stayed in Wellington, away from the level 3 restrictions. "We clearly need to debate our strategy. We can't afford endless lockdowns, we don't want to let the virus in, so how do we innovate our way out this?" Seymour said. The debating chamber will be emptier than usual with social distancing and Auckland MPs from across the political spectrum told to stay-put. This won't effect business in the House - it has been agreed there will be no limit on proxy votes. National Party leader Judith Collins is looking forward to getting back into the debating chamber - albeit with fewer MPs. "Well, I'm delighted that Parliament will actually give some scrutiny to the actions of the government," Collins said. Behind the scenes, the pressure is on. Political parties now have to re-schedule their campaigns and the Electoral Commission has to reconfirm it's voting day venues and staff. All this before Parliament dissolves on 6 September, which is when the campaign is set to kick off - again.

One of the questions in votesafe.nz's quiz on euthanasia. Photo: Supplied / votesafe.nz Henoch Kloosterboer fromVote Safe NZtold Checkpoint many people he speaks to do not know some of the basics of the proposed law."They can take a simple 10-question quiz which will help them to upskill on some of these less-known details that are very relevant and important to how we decide to vote."We're not really wanting to tell people how to vote, we're just wanting to make sure everyone is truly informed on the wider implications of what the Act would allow."He said he was also campaigning for a delay to the election, and had launched an online petition that garnered 2500 signatures before the prime ministers announcement on Monday morning.He said there hadbeen confusion about the topics and more time would help."People are not necessarily up to the play with what it's actually about or not about."We're hearing a lot of people who believe the referendum is actually about things like turning off life support or 'do not resuscitate' orders, or palliative medication that may hasten death, whereas all of these options are already legal currently."But the bills proponent and number one campaigner David Seymour - who saidthe prime minister had no choice but to delay the election - saidit was patronising to say people were not across the detail."And I would caution my opponents from belittling or patronising the New Zealand people. The New Zealand people have what I call a finely-honed 'BS' detector and I warn my opponents not to trigger those detectors because it won't help them in their effort to turn people against choice," he said.He saidthe government referendum website was to be best trusted for information, though opponents of the bill saidthey were unhappy with the way theofficial questions are explained on that site.They argued the phrase assisted dying actually reflectedsomething that was already legal and current practice in New Zealand, and "lethal dose was more accurate language that should be used.Voters will also get more time to mull over marijuana, with Chloe Swarbrick saying she was happy there was more time to convince people."There's just greater opportunity to have those conversations with people and in my experience, unless you're approaching somebody who is not all too willing to open themselves up to the evidence, most people do end up coming around to the fact that a more sensible control and regulation of cannabis makes far more sense than the status quo that we've got," she said.She said there were some questions to be asked about campaign spending, now that all parties may be at risk of breaching their caps.Bob McCoskrie from Family First has been on a national tour to talk down both referendum topics, and says the lockdown has cut short their plans."Very difficult to have public meetings and engage with people face to face. I don't think we want to have a whole campaign online, you miss out a whole proportion of the population."He saidhes happy for more time and thoughtit wouldultimately suit the no campaigns.The Electoral Commission said it was still working through the impact of the date change on expenditure limits and what that means for parties and campaigners.It says it will be giving updated guidelines as soon as possible.

Mark Rawson says the election needs to be "done and dusted" in as short a time as possible. Photo: RNZ / Tracy Neal Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the change less than a week after raising the Covid-19 alert levels across the country to deal with the Auckland outbreak. In the midst of their two-week lockdown, some Aucklanders in Mngere were happy to hear they had more time before the election. Fuaal Seve said the four-week delay was a good move. "People might not be able to go to vote because a lot of people are ageing and there's a risk," she said. "It's a good idea." James Ball said politicians needed more time to showcase their policies after months of everyone being bombarded with Covid-19 news. "It's a good thing that all the politicians have a bit more time to come up with what they'd like New Zealand to look like in the future." The brother of former prime minister Sir Bill English, Thomas Dermot English, said the delay had to happen. "There's constitutional constructions ... you can't push it too far back and if you have it soon, especially in Auckland, no-one gets a chance to have their say when they're standing for Parliament. It's a good in-between," he said. In Christchurch, the prime minister's announcement drew some surprise. Jacinda Ardern's announcement has mostly been praised around the country although one Christchurch voter wanted the election in September. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Louise Wilson had hoped for a different outcome. "I just thought well, you know, keep the date. There's no biggie really, but it's just campaigning which costs lots of money so I would have been happy to for it to stay in September." But it was a decision that Carol Chinpoy expected. "Well, actually not surprised because there's so much focus on Covid at the moment so it would be crazy trying to vote for anyone really." Andy Larkin said four weeks arguably wasn't long enough - he'd like it pushed back until at least November. "I'd be talking at least two months until we can hopefully get the ramifications of Covid behind us and people can concentrate on what the parties have to offer." He said he understood the government had to balance the economy with the health and safety of the nation. Further south in Dunedin, most people spoken to by RNZ supported the move. "With the coronavirus and everything, yep, I think it's a good idea," Darrell said. Cameron didn't mind when the election was if he could still vote. "I mean I guess as long as there's legal precedent for it. I mean it is extraordinary circumstances I guess with an epidemic going on. As long as they have an election, I'm ok with it." Ardern has committed to no more election date changes - a move Warrington resident Gareth didn't agree with. "The politicians should have one month of electioneering before the actual vote," he said. "It would be totally wrong to be in the level 3 or 2 or whatever, and prevent the politicians going out and about to get their votes in." In Nelson, central city businessman Tim Babbage said the decision wasn't rocket science. "You can't have an election in the middle of a pandemic. People have to be able to go out and vote." The head of the Nelson Economic Development Agency, Mark Rawson, said the delay was sensible. "Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty and that's not going to be solved in the next six to 12 months. It is quite important though that we get this done and dusted in as short a time period as possible so that the business community have some level of certainty to deal with in the next couple of years, which are going to be pretty tough." Advance voting will start on 3 October before election day on 17 October.

National Party leader Judith Collins and New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters. Photo: RNZ/Simon Rogers & Stuff The country's general election date has been postponed to 17 October from 19 September. Parliament which was due for dissolution today will now be pushed to 6 September. Peters told Nine to Noon the election being postponed gives parties the time to go out and campaign. In the previous circumstance, parties had just six days before overseas voting and nine days before special votes was due to begin. "That's just impossible. We're a country the size of the UK and campaigns to be run properly have to be fair and the public's got to know there's no limitation on them being part of the campaign - they after all the major player in the campaign. "Then you have the health override where people - in our view - are not going to come because they were concerned about their health being imperilled in being part of the process." He says moving the date was the best thing to do. "I'm glad that she's [Jacinda Ardern] made that decision." He says it gave parties the time to up their game but will not say what happens if the election were to be postponed again. "Democracy is not a spectator sport, democracy is where everybody turns up to play and the voter is king. And if there's a health fear that they have that we have to deal with that first." As for him sending the letter to the Governor-General and the prime minister about the majority of House of Representatives' thoughts on delaying the election, he says: "I merely pointed out the obvious. No more, no less. "I expressed confidence in the prime minister not a lack of it." He says the date change benefits all parties. National leader Judith Collins says the new election date was Jacinda Ardern's decision and the party will work with it. Collins told Nine to Noon her personal preference was for 21 November. "The main thing is, we can't have a fair election with no public meetings, two referenda being voted on, people not able to actually put their views on that without actually being able to have those public meetings." Collins said she had no confidence that the government's border system would be corrected by an earlier election date. "Nobody checking the checkers is clearly what's been happening," she said. "Ultimately elections are not about the prime minister or myself, they're about the people. If the Electoral Commission thought it was unsafe, then it would be pretty hard to hold it." Collins says she was unhappy with the arrangement of the Epidemic Response Committee during the country's first lockdown. There needs to be real parliamentary scrutiny, she says. "I've said to Jacinda Ardern that I don't think it's ideal at a time like this to not have parliamentary scrutiny and I don't think it's ideal to run the committee in the same way that it was run last time." With Parliament's dissolution now postponed, National MPs based in Auckland will be told to stay in Auckland, she says. "Those who are in a reasonable distance of Wellington, we're trying to get them back but the main thing is, we have a group core of people here." Green Party co-leader James Shaw is accusing National, ACT and New Zealand First of political blackmail to delay the election. Shaw said the language used by some parties had been unhelpful. While there are legitimate concerns about the election date, the way some political parties have exploited that for political gain was unacceptable, he said. Collins preference for a 21 November election date put the public's faith in the democratic process at risk, he said. He said National was laying the groundwork for the option of not accepting the election result, on the grounds that the date did not suit. "It has an extremely corrosive effect. If you look at what's happened in the United States - not just in the United States but they're obviously the leading example around the world - clearly over the long-term it has made that country virtually ungovernable in a time of crisis and I think that if politicians continue that type of behaviour here in New Zealand you could see us go the same way." David Seymour, left, and James Shaw. Photo: RNZ Act Party leader David Seymour said the prime minister had made the right decision. He said a 17 October election was the best of a bad set of choices. "Of course we don't know what's going to happen next month or indeed in October but I think the prime minister has made the right decision to have a straight four weeks at level 1." Seymour said it was better to let people deal with immediate anxieties, such as their livelihoods or education, and then have an election.

Missed the announcement? Watch it here The Covid-19 outbreak in Auckland has forced the suspension of political campaigning and prompted calls to postpone the general election. The election will now be held on 17 October. It follows calls from coalition partner New Zealand First and both opposition partners to delay the election because of the effects Covid-19 restrictions would have on electioneering. Jacinda Ardern said she would not change the election date again. If a further outbreak followed: "My view is we will be sticking with the date we have," she said. The decision was hers alone, she says. "The date I've chosen actually is my view." "Even if I had not picked up the phone and contacted anyone I believe this is still the outcome I would have arrived at." "Covid is the world's new normal," she says. Ardern says she factored in whether this was fair to Mori and Pasifika voters. She says everyone she reached out to for their opinion on moving the election date was very considered but the general view was that some form of delay was warranted. The Electoral Commission had been planning since April for a range of scenarios including the election being held with the country being at alert level 2 and parts of the country being at level 3. The commission advised the prime minister four weeks allowed it the necessary time to provide information to voters and book venues to stage polling booths. Ardern says she considered moving the election two weeks, but the commission said this would not be enough time to do organisation such as rebooking venues. Dissolution of Parliament was now scheduled for Sunday 6 September, and early voting would begin on 3 October. When questioned on whether the threat of a motion of no confidence had affected her decision to delay the election, especially considering New Zealand First leader Winston Peters' very public call for a delay, Ardern said it did not. "I personally didn't consider that a threat in the first place. Obviously, a no confidence vote would trigger an election." She took into account the view of all parties' leaders in deciding to delay the election date. She wanted to provide Parliament and the public "certainty, a sense of fairness, and a sense of comfort to voters that this will be a safe election". New Zealand First and the Green Party were informed of the decision before Ardern made the announcement. Photo: RNZ/Vinay Ranchhod Ardern says under the law, once Parliament has dissolved, if the Electoral Commission believes they cannot hold a safe election they have the power to move the date. It's already anticipated a large number of people will advance vote. "I absolutely have confidence we can and will deliver a safe election." She says she doesn't wish for her Auckland Labour MPs to come out of Auckland to attend Parliament. "I have thought about every single element of this." She says some candidates will have taken unpaid leave to campaign. But she believes this is a balanced decision. "I think it would be entirely inappropriate that this decision be seen as political partisanship ... it wasn't." It would not have been appropriate to make a decision based on any individual party, she says. "In these circumstances, in these times, what we need is the ability to make these decisions very quickly." "I have absolutely no intention at all to change this..." The Labour Party will not re-launch its campaign. Hoardings will not need to be taken down, she says. "These are very extraordinary circumstances." New Zealand First leader Winston Peters welcomed the delay saying he was pleased common sense had prevailed. "We were concerned that the Covid outbreak had the effect of limiting campaigns to an unacceptably short period until overseas and advance voting begin if the general election was held on September 19," he said in a statement. "With a delay, parties can now prepare to begin campaigning again, confident that they have the time and resources to engage in a free and fair election." Photo: RNZ/Vinay Ranchhod

Health Minister Chris Hipkins. Photo: RNZ / Dan Cook Hipkins stood in for the prime minister this morning. Jacinda Ardern is set to announce today if the election date of 19 September will be delayed, "I'm confident they've got very good protocols in place to ensure everybody is being kept safe," Hipkins told Morning Report. He says people being able to safely vote is critical in deciding the election date. "There isn't a risk-free option of course because we're dealing with the virus. Who knows what may happen in any given week or month?" It is up to the commission to ensure everyone's vote is counted, he says. "The question the prime minister will be weighing up today is what's the best thing from a logistical perspective in making sure that everybody can vote and everybody's vote can be counted." Green co-leader James Shaw said calls for a delay to the election were politicking. "I think it's 100 percent electioneering. There are some political parties who are clearly prioritising their electoral fortunes over the health of our communities and strength of our democracy and I think that's extremely disappointing. Shaw said National Party leader Judith Collins was "essentially laying the groundwork to be able to say that unless she gets what she wants then she'll be able to declare the election illegitimate. "I think that's incredibly dangerous." Collins has said it was impossible to campaign in a way that could produce a fair result "if a lot of people are frightened to leave their house or even frightened of having postal ballots ... particularly the elderly, many are being too frightened to even receive an envelope because they're worried there could be Covid-19 on them". New Zealand First leader Winston Peters released a letter sent to Ardern on 14 August, in which he said the ability for parties to campaign for a 19 September election had been "fatally compromised." "[Peters] is clearly flirting with the idea of creating a political crisis, if you read between the lines of what he was saying yesterday." Shaw said the important thing was to have certainty. "The thing that's really disappointing at the moment is you've had a number of political parties making what I judge to be nakedly political plays in their own advantage and so I hope the prime minister makes her choice based on the good advice of our health officials and the Electoral Commission. "We should stick with the date that we've got unless the advice coming back from the Electoral Commission and health officials is that it means that the circumstances are that we won't be able to conduct a proper election at that time." ACT leader David Seymour's call for a month at level 1 before an election would mean the election was a "moving target" because there was no guarantee there wouldn't be another outbreak before the next date, he said. Shaw said a short delay to the election date was a "very real possibility" but it was up to the prime minister to determine this.

Jacinda Ardern has taken the weekend to look at the latest advice from justice officials and speak to a number of different people. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas The Covid-19 outbreak in Auckland has forced the suspension of political campaigning, and prompted calls to postpone the general election. The decision is solely in the hands of the Prime Minister; Jacinda Ardern has taken the weekend to look at the latest advice from justice officials and speak to a number of different people. But there's plenty of pressure piling on - with parties, including coalition partner New Zealand First, lining up to argue for a delay. The constitutional clock is also ticking with the dissolution of Parliament scheduled to take place today, after being delayed last week. If dissolution does not go ahead today, a date later than 19 September will have to be chosen. Ardern's already bought herself some time, but a decision will have to be made today - either way. She's been sounding out a number of people; one happy to make his views known is New Zealand First leader and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters called for the election to be postponed. Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson He released a letter sent to Ardern on 14 August, in which he said community transmission in Auckland had already disrupted electioneering. Read Winston Peters' letter (PDF: 232KB) The ability for parties to campaign for a 19 September election had been "fatally compromised," he wrote. If the level 3 lockdown in Auckland was extended, the legitimacy of next month's election would be undermined, he said, adding it would be "neither free nor fair." Voters need to hear from all political parties about their Covid-19 response plans and other policies, but until Auckland's alert level drops the "playing field is hopelessly compromised," he said. He released the letter publicly "for the sake of transparency, and because we believe the Governor General of New Zealand needs to know that the majority in the House of Representatives favours an election delay". If dissolution doesn't happen first, the parliamentary term will automatically expire on 13 October - the latest an election could be held is late November. With a 75 percent majority, Parliament could delay the election until next year - but even with New Zealand First joining the opposition, those wanting to delay would not have the 90 votes needed without Labour. Peters says his party still backs coalition partner Labour, so it retains the confidence of the House. When asked whether that would remain its position if Ardern pushed ahead with 19 September, Peters said he wouldn't talk about "hypotheticals". His party would do everything it possibly could towards holding "free and fair elections", he said, because otherwise "the quality of this democracy will be seriously diluted, diminished and we'll look back on it as a terrible time in our history". National's leader Judith Collins says it's impossible to campaign in a way that could produce a fair result, "if a lot of people are frightened to leave your house or even frightened of having postal ballots ... particularly the elderly, many are being too frightened to even receive an envelope because they're worried there could be Covid-19 on them". National leader Judith Collins calls for the election to be delayed Photo: RNZ National would support 21 November an alternative election date, she says, as it would give parties a "a good opportunity to even start getting the policies out" and time "to cope" with another lockdown in the interim. The Greens question the wisdom in pushing the date out saying there's no guarantee things will be better at a later date. ACT says two more week's lockdown for Auckland means the election should be delayed. Leader David Seymour says there should be at least four weeks of campaigning under level 1 before an election could be held. The Electoral Commission has been planning for an election with physical distancing, sanitising and other precautions, but says a safe election couldn't be held at level 3 or higher. Sticking with 19 September leaves little wiggle room, if for example, Auckland's restrictions are extended or there's another flare up. Even now with level 3 due to end on 26 August , it's then only a week before overseas voting starts on Wednesday 2 September and advance voting two days later. An election date of 21 November gives more time but there's still no guarantee New Zealand will be Covid free and it's a longer time to have Parliament not sitting. Having the election on 17 October eases that problem, while giving an extra month for campaigning. If the date is pushed back to October or November serious consideration would have to be given to re-establishing something like the opposition-run Epidemic Response committee, if there is to be any formal scrutiny of what the government is doing under its 'resurgence plan'. In a statement Ardern said she has "proactively sought the views of the leaders of every political party represented in Parliament" and "taken on board" the range of views expressed. She might be short on time as she weighs her decision - but she won't be short on others' opinions.

Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Public health experts say the government wasted the 100 days New Zealand was free of community transmission. They say any inquiry could offer advice to officials every few months, guiding the response to any future outbreaks. The last time a government reviewed its response to a pandemic was 100 years ago, after the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak. About 9000 people died in about eight weeks as that pandemic swept through the country. That review found the immediate outlook of New Zealand's health services "did not inspire confidence", isolating the sick could have been done better, and masks were found to have worked relatively well. The review sparked wide ranging changes to the health system in New Zealand that are still praised today. Since then there have been a dozen pandemics of various intensity, including SARS, swine flu and Zika virus, but none of them convinced health officials nor the government's of the time that a review of pandemic preparedness was needed. Epidemiologist Michael Baker said that needs to change, and quick. "The classic comment from historians is that we never learn the lessons of history," Baker said. "So I think it is quite profound if we look back on these past events and say, 'did we learn from them?' I think sometimes we have, and sometimes we haven't. "This one, I hope we do learn and I think the learning has to start right away rather than deferring it, because this is not like the 1918 influenza pandemic. This is going to be with the world for a long time, until we work out ways of controlling it." Baker's colleague at the University of Otago, public health expert Nick Wilson, said officials sat back and basked in New Zealand's relative success during past pandemics, which meant systems and plans were not reviewed to an adequate standard. "It is very difficult for the politicians and policy makers to say, this was a terrible thing overseas, SARS, let's learn everything we can from it and incorporate it in our pandemic plan." Wilson said that was an oversight, and the government needs to launch an inquiry which can help determine New Zealand's response as the pandemic continues. "All the time we're learning more about the epidemiology, how it's transmitted. "We're learning more about how effective treatments might be, the potential for a vaccine, the potential for using digital technologies to dramatically improve the scope for contact tracing. "We learnt recently how much more effective masks are." Both Nick Wilson and Michael Baker say the government wasted time by not launching an inquiry while New Zealand was at alert level 1. They say it is understandable to wait until the Auckland outbreak is under control to begin a review. But there are experts in place who could start reviewing the nationwide response right away, without taking away from the effort to eliminate community transmission in Auckland. Baker said the inquiry cannot wait until the pandemic has passed. "I think we need to do this now, because we have to think about at least another year when this pandemic will obviously be very intense globally, and before we might get a vaccine. "And even if we get a vaccine, we still have to think about how to deliver that." *See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19 Baker said the government needs to follow the example of 1918, and not the public health performance since. "New Zealand has systematically eroded and fragmented its public health capacity over the 25 years or more that I've been working in the system. "We can just do so much better." Health Minister Chris Hipkins said the government will launch a review, but not right now. "It's inevitable that we will get to the point where that is sensible, but at the moment all of our focus is on the response. "I don't want to take people off the response to do too much reflective thinking when actually we need all eyes focused forward on making sure that we're dealing with what is in front of us right now." The government has given no indication of when a review might begin.

Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas It comes after the revelation yesterday that a First Security guard at an Auckland hotel had been suspended after releasing the personal information of 27 returnees and five staff members on Snapchat over the weekend. Today Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the government is deploying an extra 500 defence force personnel, which would reduce reliance on security firms especially in high risk facilities. "Our intention is to stop using private security contractors particularly in the riskiest places, such as entry and exit points in public areas and replace them with defence force staff. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas "Where we are using security guards, we're looking to directly employ them by MBIE who will train and pay a living wage. This will raise accountability and give more central control over procedures. "While the current community cluster has not been sourced to a managed isolation and quarantine facility, strengthening security is always an important step," she said, adding that Minister Megan Woods has been working on this for some time. The change will bring the total defence force personal working on the Covid-19 response to about 1200, making it New Zealand's largest military contingent since Timor-Leste, according to the government. The minister in charge of managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ), Megan Woods, said the boost was part of a "continual improvement process" for Covid-19 border measures. "This boost in defence force personnel will be progressively rolled out over the next six weeks and will see the number in each managed isolation and quarantine facility increase from around 4 people to 19 people, and also see around 80 extra personnel stationed at the maritime border to assist Customs." Thirty staff will be deployed to Auckland this Thursday to staff the first two MIQ facilities. Each week after that, 75 people will be provided until each MIQ is staffed by an additional complement of 15 NZDF staff. The increase in NZDF staff would also reduce reliance on security companies, Woods said. "(NZDF) will staff the higher risk security areas such as entry and exit points and public areas. We will be moving to a model of direct employment of security guards with the appropriate training and paying the living wage." There are currently 32 managed isolation and quarantine facilities. The government had also been trialling the use of technology such as CCTV to help with the management of the perimeters at the facilities, and that was likely to be rolled out more widely, Woods said. "Since managed isolation started around four months ago, almost 40,000 people have successfully been through managed isolation and quarantine facilities. "While the current community cluster has not been sourced to a managed isolation and quarantine facility, nothing is fail-safe and strengthening security is a step we believe is useful."
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423722/finance-minister-outlines-new-wage-subsidy-scheme-in-alert-level-3|2020-08-17|The Finance Minister has announced that workers whose jobs may be affected by the re-emergence of Covid-19 in Auckland will be supported by a new wage subsidy scheme and a simplified leave scheme. Missed the announcement? Watch it here again: Grant Robertson set out the criteria for a new nationwide wage subsidy scheme covering the period Auckland is in alert level 3. "This is a very focused extension of the wage subsidy scheme...it is possible for us to extend it out further if that is needed," Robertson said, which could be in the current term and could look forward to 10 September. Level 3 restrictions in Auckland and level 2 restrictions across the rest of New Zealand will end at 11.59pm on 26 August. Robertson said Auckland made up 40 percent of GDP and had a huge spillover impact on the rest of the country. He said an estimated 930,000 jobs would be supported by the new scheme, and the extension of the existing wage subsidy scheme - which is open until 1 September for eligible businesses. "The government is again moving quickly to cushion the blow for businesses and workers," he said. "We know in New Zealand that the best economic response is a strong health response. We've seen the benefits to the economy by going hard and early to get on top of the virus, with activity in June and July running above levels seen last year as the economy reopened after lockdown and business got going again." The criteria for the new wage subsidy are similar to the current extension: In particular, a business must have had, or is predicting to have, a revenue drop due to Covid-19 of at least 40 percent. For this new scheme, the revenue drop applies for any consecutive period of at least 14 days within 12 August and 10 September compared to last year. "You have to nominate one period of 14 days within that period." The costs are expected to be covered by the previous underspend on the extended wage subsidy. Robertson said the government has also removed the revenue drop and the 'negatively impacted' tests for the Leave Support Scheme. "This means businesses with workers who have been told by health officials or their medical practitioner to self-isolate will receive the equivalent of the wage subsidy to help cover that person's wages for the time they cannot be at work." The mortgage deferral scheme is also being extended to 31 March next year. It has been run by the banks, and Robertson said he had received very few complaints about that scheme "An awful lot of businesses had got themselves up and running again...for many of them it was a blow to their confidence more than anything else." Robertson said further work was being done to ensure support continues to be adaptable and flexible for alert level movements, including on the Small Business Cashflow Loan Scheme and potential further changes to the Leave Support Scheme. The new wage subsidy scheme will be open for applications by 21 August. Businesses around the country have been calling for a much longer extension to the subsidy than the government is offering. It's being anxiously anticipated by those industries which are being hit hardest by another lockdown, such as hospitality and tourism. National Party's finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said the additional wage subsidy was essential, but as a long-term economic solution, there could not be failures at the border. "The foundation of any economic plan to get New Zealand back in shape is to have effective border containment and if we are not doing that and if we are not testing the people who work at the border properly, then people find that astounding and that is a huge risk to take," he said. Goldsmith said the second lockdown would cost more jobs and put families under intense pressure.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423661/peters-pushes-for-election-to-be-postponed|2020-08-16|New Zealand First leader Winston Peters wants the election delayed, saying there is now no ability to conduct a free and fair election on 19 September. Winston Peters has passed on his request to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Photo: STUFF/POOL He has written to the Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and has asked for her to delay the general election to 21 November. National says it could back 21 November as the new date. Ardern will reveal tomorrow morning if the election will go ahead next month, or if it will be delayed because of the cluster of Covid-19 in Auckland. Last week she delayed the dissolution of Parliament until tomorrow, in light of the new community outbreak. In the letter, sent to Ardern on 14 August, Peters said community transmission in Auckland had already disrupted electioneering, with all political parties suspending their campaigns. The ability for parties to campaign for a 19 September election had been "fatally compromised," he wrote. If the level 3 lockdown in Auckland is extended, the legitimacy of next month's election would be undermined, he said, adding it would be "neither free nor fair". Voters need to hear from all political parties about their Covid response plans and other policies, but until Auckland's alert level drops the "playing field is hopelessly compromised," he said. Political parties would have only six days to campaign before overseas voting begins on 2 September and nine days before advance voting begins if Ardern doesn't delay the election, Peters said. The legitimacy of the election result could be undermined if Ardern chose not to delay the election,"creating an awful precedent which could be abused by the prime minister's successors", he said. "People will be driven to the conclusion, in the absence of any empirical evidence to the contrary, that the election date choice is being forced from a minority position to achieve a certain outcome," Peters added. Peters believed holding an election under level 2 would be "hugely problematic" as about 750,000 voters would be asked to lodge postal votes. In his letter, Peters said he was alarmed to read in a briefing given to the Minister of Justice, Andrew Little, on 12 August, that stated "there are capacity limits to the number of postal votes the Commission can process". This raised serious questions, he said, such as whether there is operational capacity to cope with the volume of postal votes in Auckland and potentially elsewhere, if the postal system can ensure no legitimate votes are rejected and the fairness of the result if older and more vulnerable New Zealanders cannot vote in-person. Little declined to comment when contacted by RNZ. Since receiving the Peters' letter, Ardern has spoken to the New Zealand First leader. She will announce her decision at 10am tomorrow.

Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon Shaw was advised to take a precautionary test after developing minor cold symptoms following a trip to the city last weekend, where the party unveiled its housing policy. He thanked all those who were patient while he awaited his test result and those who have also since been tested. "Obviously I'm allowed out of the house now, which is a delight for me and also I imagine a great relief to probably several hundred people who I have had contact with over the course of the last week," he said. Shaw said everyone in the office had been working from home for several days and some who had winter cold symptoms were tested as well. Meanwhile, the Green Party has had to cancel a large number of events around the country, including Auckland, during what would have been the party's first serious week of campaigning. As a result, the party's morale had taken a bit of a hit, Shaw said. "Of course we have all been trapped in Parliament getting through that emergency legislation and everyone was really keen to get out on the road. "We are really keen to get out campaigning, and so within the boundaries of public health and safety we will do everything we can to get ourselves in front of voters over the next few weeks," he said. Shaw said the Greens were doing a lot of Zoom events during lockdown and may adopt more digital campaigning in the leadup to the election.

File photo. Photo: RNZ / Nick Monro St Joseph's Catholic School is worried it will lose enrolments and says the decision is based on its outdated school decile number. A member of the school's board of trustees, Michal Akurangi, said she had two children at St Joseph's and she was disappointed they and 260 others at the school would not be getting free lunches next term. "Well it will definitely single us out from all the other schools, but also the stress will still be on those families to provide lunches for the children. I think it's just a bit unfair really." She said the town was struggling under the combined impact of Covid-19 and last year's eruption on nearby Whakaari / White Island and the lunch scheme would be a big help to the community. The school's principal, Jo Brady, said she was surprised to learn that the other nine schools in the local Community of Learning group were all in the scheme. "The first I heard of it was some of the schools in the community of learning mentioned that they'd been approached for the lunches in schools programme, and then more and more until everybody said 'hey we've been approached for lunches in schools'. So at that point the board of trustees and myself contacted the local ministry and said 'hey what's going on'." She said she was told that as a decile six school, St Joseph's was not eligible. But she said the rating was out of date and the other schools were in deciles four or five, not much different to her school. "Probably the bit that is the most ironic is that when my children leave this school next year, all of my Year 8s will be eligible for a free lunch at both high schools," she said. Brady said she was worried some families would move their children to schools where they could get a free lunch. She said the school was applying to have its decile recalculated in the hope that it could be included in the lunch programme next year. Brady said the school had children from low-income families and she was worried some families might leave the school so they could get free lunches for their children. The Education Ministry had previously told RNZ it was using the new equity index, which was being developed to replace the decile system, to inform decisions about which schools were in the lunch scheme. The index used official, anonymous data about individual children's family circumstances unlike the decile, which used data about groups of households in a neighbourhood.

She is still standing as the party's candidate for Manurewa. In the days leading up to the party's choice of a candidate to replace Nikki Kaye, who is retiring, it emerged that a man calling himself Merv phoned Marcus Lush on NewstalkZB to discuss Samarakone's campaign. Newshub claimed that the caller was party board member Roger Bridge who is also the chairperson of the party's Canterbury Westland region. Earlier this week Bridge did not respond to RNZ's calls, but denied he was the caller when questioned by Newshub outside Parliament. National Party president Peter Goodfellow said since the party became aware of the allegations the issue has been thoroughly investigated and discussed. He said Bridge tendered his resignation at a meeting of the board yesterday, and it was accepted. Goodfellow said everyone makes mistakes, and this was an unfortunate situation for someone who has given many years of loyal service to the National party. He said the board now considers the matter closed. Peter Goodfellow said the events leading up to the resignation were unfortunate.

Chris Hipkins said compulsory Covid testing has now been implemented for all staff working at the border. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas There are currently 30 active cases of Covid-19 outside of managed isolation, in the Auckland and Waikato regions, after 13 new cases were annonced this afternoon. Chris Hipkins said for New Zealand to move up to alert level 4 there would need to be a number of clusters and cases unrelated to the clusters, and that is not the case at this point. He said more cases related to the current Covid-19 cluster have been found, but would not answer if the new cases had spread to further regions saying more information would be available at the 1pm briefing today. Otago University Professor Sir David Skegg told Morning Report that the lack of testing for border staff was extraordinary with reports that more than 60 percent of staff working at the border had never been tested. Hipkins agreed the testing of border staff was too slow to get off the ground. But he said testing numbers for border staff had increased by last week. "So we 2796 test results by the end of last week, obviously the numbers were ramping up significantly last week." Follow the latest on RNZ's live blog Hipkins said any border staff who showed any symptoms were immediately taken out of work and tested. "We don't go to compulsory testing lightly, the idea that the government mandates that someone must undergo a medical procedure is a pretty heavy trigger to pull." But Hipkins said compulsory testing has now been implemented for all border staff. "Testing people who aren't coming into contact with passengers and who aren't showing any symptoms and making that compulsory, that's quite a high bar to set - we've now done that. Yes we were slow to do that but with very good reasons." Hipkins said not everybody in the medical community agrees that a weekly test was justified or necessary. He said by the end of the weekend everybody working at the border will have been tested for Covid-19. "We will obviously make decisions about the extent to which that's going to continue to be mandatory and the frequency of that." He said prior to this community transmission not everybody in the medical community agreed that a weekly test for border staff was justified or necessary. Hipkins said the government has been clear from day one that the return of community transmission was a possible scenario. Any GP practice who finds they do not have enough Covid swab supplies should talk to the Ministry of Health and they will ensure they get them, Hipkins said. Hipkins said the government is still working through whether it can be justified in making mask wearing mandatory. "The message to everybody though is this is a sensible precaution that everybody can take voluntarily, it shouldn't need for us to make it compulsory for people to do the right thing." National's Health spokesperson said if his party was in government it would be far more rigid in testing those working at the borders. Dr Shane Reti said good policies were not being applied properly. "I mean there's been a testing regime at the border that hasn't been adhered to as well as it should of," he said. "We're pretty firm on following policies ... and so in our hands we'd be much more rigid with the mostly good policies that the government has in place, it's just delivering those policies that seems to be the problem." National Party leader Judith Collins yesterday morning said that she been demanding a briefing for Reti, since the Auckland's move to Alert Level 3 was announced on Wednesday. Reti said he did receive a briefing from the government yesterday which included a very productive meeting with Health Minister Chris Hipkins. He said he is now satisfied that his party is being properly consulted with.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will inform Aotearoa of the decision on alert levels this evening. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Then, at 5.30pm, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will step up to the podium in the all-too-familiar Beehive theatrette and announce the plan to get things back on track after New Zealand's elimination strategy severely derailed this week. It all comes after a new cluster of community transmission caused the country to go up alert levels, with 13 new cases confirmed yesterday in addition to the four announced on Tuesday. Ardern's message has always been to go hard and go early. "Once again we are reminded of how tricky this virus is and how easily it can spread, but we know that limiting people-to-people contact really helps stop the spread," Ardern said. "We have a plan, we have acted quickly and now we will continue to roll out that plan." Within six hours of the first case of community transmission returning a positive test on Tuesday afternoon the public had been told the alert levels were changing. In less than 24 hours Auckland was in level 3 lockdown and the rest of the country had moved to level 2. "I acknowledge the anxiety of some New Zealanders as we are moving at pace to stamp out Covid in our community and protect the health of all New Zealanders, but the pace and the speed should also act as an extra layer of reassurance," Ardern said. What we knew about clusters was they "grow before they slow", and Ardern was preparing people for case numbers to continue to rise, she said. She only needs to look across the ditch to Victoria to see just how badly and quickly things can unravel when it comes to the spread of Covid-19. "In Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Victoria - which are all managing the re-emergence of Covid - they in some cases waited three or four weeks before implementing restrictions similar to ours," she said. Ardern would not speculate on best and worst case scenarios Cabinet would be discussing today. All the way through the pandemic, ministers had made decisions based on the latest information to hand - including the most recent advice from the Director General of Health - who would see another round of testing results this morning, she said. But whatever the decision is, both National and ACT say Ardern should not be the one delivering the news to the public. National Party leader Judith Collins said it was a health issue the country is facing and that was who should be informing the public. "Certainly this close to an election it is, I think, very important if it's made on health reasons the experts in health are actually the people advising that," Collins said. ACT's leader David Seymour agreed. "If there's a genuine public health issue, that's actually the chief executive and the minister of health. If there is a law enforcement issue, that is the chief executive or the commissioner of police and the minister of police. "If there is an issue that is genuinely all of government, then that is perhaps an issue for the prime minister, but at the moment we're seeing a lot of Jacinda Ardern and not much separation between prime minister and Labour leader," Seymour said. Neither Seymour nor Collins will be sitting around the Cabinet table as ministers determine what happens next later today. But if Auckland - or any other part of the country - was to move alert levels, Collins wanted the public given ample time to prepare. "I think people do need to have a bit of notice and I do think that people, wherever possible, need to be brought along on that journey," Collins said. Ardern has signalled that if there was a change to alert levels, the public would be given enough time to prepare. Health Minister Chris Hipkins said a number of factors would be considered when Cabinet met this afternoon. "I think spread of the virus; the number of active cases; the number of new cases that we're seeing each day; the number of overall test both in Auckland and also around the rest of the country and what those test results are showing us. All of those things will come into play," Hipkins said. If Auckland does face even longer in lockdown then Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Treasury have already begun drawing up more support for those hit financially.

James Shaw (file photo) Photo: RNZ / Nate McKinnon National leader Judith Collins wants the prime minister to postpone the election until late November, or preferably next year. Yesterday she said it was impossible to have free and fair elections in the circumstances. "We are a first-world liberal democracy where people expect to be able to cast their vote and if we can't think of ways to do it properly then we need to delay the election ... if it's just a postal vote, then no - that's not good enough", she said. However Shaw said Collins' concerns were purely political. "National are relying on the economy to get weaker ... and so the later the election is, the more likely, in their view, that the economy will suffer and that therefore their political fortunes will rise," he said. Shaw said any decision regarding the election date should be made by the Electoral Commission. "They were given additional funding to be able to run an election with the country at level 2 and parts of it at level 3 and I really think it should be their call. "If their advice to the prime minister is, look, we think that turnout or viability is at risk, that is the point at which the election should shift." Shaw said moving the election to a date in October or November, or even next year, did not provide any more certainty as there was always the risk there would be another outbreak. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said now was not the time to be thinking about the election date, and the focus needed to be on "health first, politics second". "The general election and the campaign that precedes it needs to be free and fair for all concerned - parties, candidates, officials, and most of all voters. "If that means delay then so be it. But that is for another day. Today we need our team of five million mobilised once more to play their part so New Zealand can recover its previous health position," Peters said.

"It comes back to the point that we are still the government, we have an important job to do in making sure we get on top of this outbreak." "It's [Ardern's ] job to lead the country through this. Dr Bloomfield is there as the lead health official, she's doing her job as prime minister and I feel that's what New Zealanders expect of us." Any suggestion that the government had known there was community transmission before this week's events were "ridiculous nonsense" he told Morning Report. Yesterday Collins stated that her health spokesperson wasn't getting all the information he needed while deputy leader Gerry Brownlee seemed to imply that the government was hiding information. Brownlee has questioned the timing of official messaging on masks and testing. "What makes me really annoyed about this, it's not about us as politicians," Robertson said. "Mr Brownlee and Judith Collins are effectively accusing Ashley Bloomfield of being involved in some kind of collusion or cover-up with the government. He's an independent public servant who actually can't fight back so it's complete nonsense and also incredibly irresponsible." "We are all here committed to keeping New Zealanders safe and well - why on earth would we do that." National Party leader Judith Collins told Morning Report that she was not suggesting that officials knew something more about the latest Covid-19 earlier and didn't tell the public. "I have not accused Dr Bloomfield of anything, and as for Ms Ardern I'm simply pointing to the fact ... it contemplates the fact that successive governments have been very careful in the way they exercise their power [prior to] an election given the fact there is an election coming." On Brownlee's comments yesterday, she said: "He was simply stating some of the information that's been provided to us." She said Robertson's accusations were "outrageous", and her call for transparency was about National's health spokesperson, Dr Shane Reti, to be involved in Cabinet discussions on Covid-19 and for him to get the latest information as soon as possible. "He has been asking for a briefing on the health situation since early yesterday morning, promised it by Minister Chris Hipkins before noon, we are still waiting for that. "It is important in opposition to be able to ask questions without being browbeaten when we ask those questions and it's also important for us to come in behind - where we can - the government, but it's difficult to do it if we don't have that information." Collins said it was Ardern's call whether or not to delay the election, but the Electoral Commission has indicated it was doable. Robertson said the government would be making a decision on Friday afternoon on whether or not there are further alert level restrictions or whether they can be eased. "At that point in terms of issues like the election date and so on we will be able to resolve those." Greens co-leader James Shaw said he was "disheartened" to see National casting doubt about the government's Covid-19 response. He said New Zealand was able to stamp out community transmission before because of an absolute commitment and trust in good science and good government, and "now is not the time to abandon either". "To create confusion and suspicion quite frankly could result in reduced trust from our communities in the very institutions we rely on most to keep us all safe. "This could lead to less willingness to pitch in to stamp out the virus. This puts us all at risk. "I would urge New Zealanders to continue to do what we do best: work together as a community, and use our common sense", Shaw said. If restrictions continue the government will look at what economic support package can be provided and decisions would be made on Friday, Robertson said. The government might potentially tap into the $14bn it had put aside, he said. Robertson said the wage subsidy had been a very successful way of "getting money out the door" but the government is working with officials on other options as well. "Our focus will immediately be as it always has been on keeping people in work, making sure there is some confidence and some cash flow for businesses." The wage subsidy extension, small business cash flow scheme, the Covid-led support scheme and income relief scheme were still in place. Robertson said there was no indication at the moment from the health minister that further resources required for testing.

Police at a hotel being used as a managed isolation facility. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas Brenton Tarrant is set to be sentenced on 24 August, having pleaded guilty to 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one under the Terrorism Suppression Act in March. Last month the government introduced short term visa exemptions for victims, families and support people under humanitarian grounds, as about half of them are not permanent residents or citizens, and so under the current border restrictions would not normally be able to enter New Zealand. The minister in charge of isolation facilities, Megan Woods, says 53 people have arrived from places like the United Kingdom, Turkey, Jordan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Fiji, Egypt, Singapore and Australia. Thiry-four of them are victims and the rest family members and support people. Numbers provided by Victim Support show the remaining number are made up of 13 support people, one minor travelling with family, and five people booked who were unable to reach New Zealand due to travel disruptions. All of those people are now doing their 14 days' managed isolation and arrived in "plenty of time" to attend the sentencing, and support each other through what will be a "pretty difficult" period, says Woods. Of the 53, 28 are New Zealand citizens or residents, she says, but the rest needed visa exemptions for a short-term visit. While those were granted, Woods says there were no applications for exemptions from isolating for two weeks, and it was not something the government considered. "Absolutely not," she says. "The list of countries ... we have some of the people coming from mean that it's vitally important that we do have 14 days of managed isolation, so that we can continue to keep Covid-free." "The feedback I've had from the the Muslim communities here in Christchurch ... they want to make sure that Covid is kept out of New Zealand and there has been no indication that anyone would even want shorter isolation periods for this group of people." None of the 53 will have to pay for the cost of isolating, not only had they all arrived before the new regime came into force, but there was a special carve out for them in the policy when it was introduced. Given the high profile nature of the sentencing, and the potential distress for victims and families, Woods says there are special measures in place to provide "wraparound support". "We are aware that this group is coming in at a particularly traumatic time, so we're working with police who have liaison members with each of the families around the specifics of each of the family that might be needed for, for the people that are coming in. "But these are people that are coming in to support family members here in New Zealand. I think they're just incredibly pleased that in the middle of a global pandemic career, where it is incredibly difficult to move around the world, that they have been able to travel here to New Zealand to be able to support their family members, many of whom are those who lost immediate family members," says Woods. There will also be extra financial assistance from the Justice Ministry for those who suffered gunshot injuries, and the families of those killed, to help pay for travel related costs. Last week in the High Court in Christchurch, Justice Cameron Mander notified media live reporting of the hearing was banned with news of the hearing embargoed until the midday and end-of-day adjournments during the multi-day hearing. Provision has also been made for overseas media and victims and their families who could not enter New Zealand due to the Covid-19 pandemic to view the hearing remotely. However, they must agree to the reporting restrictions and additionally to not copy or capture the digital stream in any form. Justice Mander said the restrictions were intended to protect privacy and dignity of victims, and preserve the integrity of the court process. "The Court is also aware of the need to take what steps it can to minimise the re-traumatisation of victims and their families and avoid, to the extent possible, the hearing causing further potential harm," he said. The convicted terrorist is expected to speak at the hearing after firing his lawyers in July and electing to represent himself.

Judith Collins is accusing Jacinda Ardern of withholding information on some of this week's developments over the Covid-19 pandemic. Photo: RNZ / Getty Images To further complicate matters, the nationwide election campaign had been gearing up. Those on the road witnessing the up close and personal nature of campaigning, the large crowds and freedom of movement had marvelled it was happening much as usual. That, unfortunately, was short-lived. There's now serious pressure to push out the election date, starting with slowing the next steps taken to end the parliamentary term and trigger an election. It's in the hands of the prime minister for now but other parties say it wouldn't be a fair race. According to Ardern the latest it could be held is 21 November. The date would have to allow enough time to release the final election and referendums results, and for the formation of a new government, before Christmas. The main consideration will be: "Is it safe to vote?" The Electoral Commission has been planning for an election in a pandemic but under current guidelines would only go ahead under alert level 2; an election could not go ahead under the level 3 restrictions in place in Auckland. That is based on people being able to safely access polling booths with sanitising and social distancing - if they cannot it is up to ministers and political leaders to decide what would happen from there, with an obligation to put the interests of New Zealanders ahead of any political considerations. Dissolution puts in train the issuing of the "writ" for the election - up until that's issued, the prime minister has the power to change the election date, after that the Electoral Commission can invoke emergency powers, and "adjourn" voting on a week by week basis. Before doing that, though, the chief electoral officer would need to consult with Ardern and National leader Judith Collins, among others. Dissolution was supposed to take place on Parliament's front steps this morning, but ministers have pushed it out until Monday. Ardern says "essentially, that doesn't stop the government from being able to make decisions". "Cabinet continues to have a mandate to make the decisions that we've been talking about over these past 24 hours. But the Parliament dissolving does mean that, if we needed to convene Parliament for any reason, we wouldn't be able to do so." This close to a general election the governing parties have a responsibility to work constructively with others when it comes to any major decisions - especially in a crisis - and to make sure the race is as even as possible. National is calling for the 19 September election to be delayed, with Collins accusing Ardern of not consulting as fully as she should, and withholding key information about this week's decisions. Decisions will have have to be made soon, with a set timetable that has to be followed in the weeks leading up the election. If Parliament is dissolved next Monday, the election could still be held on 19 September. If it's not, the prime minister will have to choose another election date. Parliament could also force an extension of this term with a 75 percent majority, but that would have to happen before the term is formally ended. Parliament is due to be dissolved next week, although a 75 percent majority of MPs could extend it. (file photo). Photo: Screenshot/New Zealand Parliament All parties except Labour took a hit over the national lockdown earlier in the year, with National one of the worst affected. They'll be alarmed at the prospect of another extended period of Ardern leading the response and dominating the media; her personal popularity is sky high and other leaders are only too well aware of the direct risks to them. National says it is a health crisis and should be handled by the director general of health, not a politician. Campaigning has been suspended while all parties watch the developments in Auckland carefully - what happens there will determine not only how politicians take their message to the electorate but potentially the election date itself. National is fighting to keep itself in the story, by taking on Ardern over her treatment of the main opposition party. Collins and her deputy Brownlee are clearly happy to keep challenging and questioning in a way designed to keep the pressure on Ardern and her ministers, while running the risk of jarring with a public preparing to hunker down once again as a nation.

It has to be witnessed by the Clerk of the House and two other witnesses, said Clerk of the House David Wilson. Once thats done and we sign a paper to say weve witnessed it, it officially ends the Parliament. This starts the election process beginning with the issuing of the Writ by the Governor General - her formal call for an election to be held. The then Clerk-Assistant Suze Jones (left), the Deputy Clerk of the House, Rafael Gonzalez-Montero (centre) and Clerk of the House David Wilson,(right) on the steps of Parliament to witness the dissolution in 2017. Photo: VNP / Phil Smith The Writ cant be issued until Parliament ends. If you want an election before Parliament expires you need to dissolve it. Parliament comes to an end after three years, or when its dissolved. This 52nd Parliament will expire on the 13th of October. The House cant sit or pass laws or hold question time once the Parliament is dissolved said Wilson. No questions can be asked [and] select committees no longer exist, he said. So while Members are still Members of Parliament and the Government still continues to exist, there is no House for them to do any business in. The Governor General does but acts on advice of the Prime Minister as they do on all constitutional matters. The Prime Minister sets the date and advises the Governor General who then issues the proclamation and authorises someone to read it. New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary to the Queen Phillip O'Shea signs the proclamation dissolving the 51st Parliament. Photo: VNP / Phil Smith Its a formal document that has to be read out, or proclaimed, to the public. It cannot be just written down or said to someone privately. The Herald of Arms Extraordinary to the Queen is the person who holds the authority from the Governor General to read this particular proclamation. While this method sounds very olde worlde it dates all the way back to 1986. Parliament is adjourned at the moment and scheduled to sit next Tuesday (18 August), so MPs could be back in the House then if the Parliament isnt dissolved.However, the Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced Monday 17 August as the new dissolution date.But even if Parliament is dissolved it could actually be called back by the Governor General if, say, it needed to pass emergency legislation. It could do this until it expires when it hits its three year time limit (see below). It hasnt happened before though so it would be new territory. That, I think, would be novel constitutional ground to explore, said Wilson. Probably the more straightforward way is just not to dissolve it until people are sure they no longer need the Parliament to either legislate or scrutinise the Government. There are a lot of moving parts in organising an election. Those parts begin moving in sequence once Parliament dissolves. Then the Writ can be issued, candidates officially be declared, etc. Moving the dissolution has an effect on all the parts. If its delayed for too long its probably not possible to fit all those things that are required by law into the gap between dissolution and election day, said Wilson. So delay dissolution too long and you probably have to delay the election. Yes and No. The election date doesnt have to be September 19th, it could happen a little later - up until November 23rd - but Parliament cant keep sitting until then. If nothing is done, Parliament expires three years after the return of the Writ (the official results from the election beforehand), so by the 13th of October this year, said Wilson. At that point the Parliament loses its authority. In 1946 Parliament forgot to the mark the calendar, forgot the previous election had been earlier than usual and accidentally ran for two extra months. This could happen on purpose (see below), but it would need a law change. Clerk of the House David Wilson (left), Serjeant at Arms Steve Streefkerk (centre), and New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary to The Queen Philip O'Shea (right) at the dissolution of Parliament 2017. Photo: VNP / Phil Smith Once the election is officially called (when the Governor General has issued a writ), decisions about the election become the Electoral Commissions responsibility. With spooky foresight the current parliament changed the Electoral Act to give the Commission the power to adjust both the timing and the means of an election if events demand it (specifically including a health outbreak as a reason). The Commission can delay the election by an initial three days and then by up to a week at a time in a rolling adjournment. This can happen for a single electorate, an area or the whole country. The Act said this can happen if there is an unavoidable disruption likely to prevent voters voting at the polling place or places, or pose a risk to the proper conduct of the election. None of this would extend the authority of the Parliament though. If MPs wanted to keep sitting beyond October 13th but delay the election (until, say, next year), they would need to change the Constitution Act before Parliament expired which would require 75 percent of MPs to agree. Parliament extended itself twice during World War One, but the law was a bit different then. The Government continues after Parliament dissolves or expires. When Parliament dissolves backbench-MPs head home but the ministers keep being ministers and running the country. Even after the election they stay ministers (though in a more caretaker role) until new ministers are appointed. Ministerial authority derives from the Governor General (not Parliament) though the individuals are always Members of Parliament. This can only last so long though. There is also a requirement that the Governor General does call the new parliament back so it cant continue forever without a parliament and with the government in charge of things, said Wilson. Without a parliament any government would run out of money pretty quickly. Only Parliament can approve the bills that provide cash to run the country.

Chris Hipkins said Aucklanders are being asked to wear masks if they are out in public. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Chris Hipkins says the government is moving swiftly after finding community transmission of Covid-19 to avoid a situation similar to Victoria. Hipkins told Morning Report it was impossible to move too hard, too soon. He said response has been precautionary and swift. "One of the lessons from overseas is you can't be too hard, too soon, the faster you move the better your chances." Hipkins said at this stage the restrictions were for three days at this stage, which will enable more information to be gathered and at the end of this they will be able to determine a sensible course of action. People in Auckland were being asked to wear masks if they were out in public either for essential travel or supermarket shopping, Hipkins said. He said an order would be issued at midday today and making mask wearing mandatory for Aucklanders was one of the things being considered. Follow the latest on RNZ's live blog Hipkins said the government had been pushing to increase testing for Covid-19 up and in recent days had been getting around the desired 4000 mark. He said at this stage the source of this outbreak was a puzzle. "This person has no known contacts with anybody who has worked in managed isolation or at the border, they have no recent travel history themselves or contact with people who have travel history." *See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19 Hipkins said they would keep contact tracing until the source of the outbreak was discovered. "Immediate family members have been tested, therefore we've got three additional positive results out of that, so therefore the contact tracing for those family members kicked into gear immediately, as soon as their positive results tests came in and we will just keep going until we identify where the source of the case is." Testing will be undertaken at two workplaces, and Hipkins said he believed one of the children in the family attended Mt Albert Primary School. But he said that child returned a negative test and at this point the health advice was that testing was not needed for everybody at that school. Hipkins said at this stage they were in contact with anybody who had been in close contact with any of the four people who have tested positive for Covid-19. "Getting them tested is our priority and then doing further contact tracing based on those results has been the priority." Those who tested positive have been interviewed a number of times to determine who they have been in contact with and have been very cooperative, Hipkins said. He said anybody who has symptoms and wants to get a Covid-19 test should phone the 0800 Healthline number first. Hipkins said everybody who is leaving Auckland to return home today, they should stay home for the three days in the same way Aucklanders are being asked to. He said police would help to enforce the level 3 restrictions in the greater Auckland area after midday today. The area for level 3 is the Auckland Super City boundaries - from Wellsford in the north to Pukekohe in the south. Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said a police presence was likely on the borders of the area from today. "The advice is clear, if you're outside of Auckland don't come into the city, if you are living in Auckland, you're not to go outside of the Auckland boundaries unless obviously you're an emergency or an essential worker." He said Auckland did not want to replicate what happened in Melbourne. "We really need to follow the rules, we need to nip this in the bud if we can as quickly as possible, we need at all costs to try to avoid the situation that they found in Melbourne where they took five weeks over it, they didn't lock down properly and we've seen the results of that." Goff said it was going to be tough, but if the community outbreak were to get out of control it would mean a longer lockdown. The level 3 restrictions were needed for as long as necessary, he said. "I'm not pessimistic about it, we've been here before, by working together collectively, by being sensible, by following the rules, we defeated the spread of it better than any other country in the world did and we can do it again - but it's not easy." Auckland Council is closing all of its community facilities such as libraries and swimming pools, effective immediately. "Widespread testing and effective contact tracing will be the key to us defeating any further spread of this community outbreak."

Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers Labour leader Jacinda Ardern announced yesterday that there were four positive cases of Covid-19 outside of managed isolation or quarantine in Auckland. National leader Judith Collins said the need to move Auckland back into level 3 restrictions would come as a shock to many, and was devastating. "It's actually devastating for people, but what's disappointing is that we now have confirmed community outbreaks of Covid-19, that is the disappointment, for 102 days we were told there was none and people have got back to their lives and businesses. "That's what devastating to me, that we've been told we didn't have Covid-19 in the community now it turns out that we do." Collins told Morning Report she couldn't see how after so long with no community transmission, Covid-19 could " just spring up again". "I just can't see how 102 days without any Covid-19 in the country and community that that's suddenly going to spring up again somewhere, is someone seriously suggesting that it's been manifested in the community and no one's known about it? In which case what's happened to the testing?" Follow the latest here: Straight answers from the government were needed, she said. "I think there needs to be a lot of questions asked and a lot of answers given, and straight forward ones. I'm the leader of the Opposition, this is important that I ask these questions as to what's happened, how it's happened." It would be "helpful" to delay the dissolution of Parliament today if any legislation needed passing, she said. "But also we may need to debate this issue, so it's the sort of thing I'd expect the Prime Minister's office to talk to me, or my people, about because this is actually really quite serious, because it's not only Auckland, a third of the population, at level 3 but the rest of the country at Level 2." If Parliament were to be dissolved today it would limit the chance to get detailed briefings, she said. National was delaying its campaign launch, Collins said, and if the situation in Auckland didn't improve the election might need to be postponed. "I think it's inevitable that people will be asking these questions and I actually can't see how we can have the Government saying well it's all just fine and we'll get the Electoral Commission to do some postal ballots or something, that's not going to be acceptable, this is a liberal democracy and people do need to be able to have a fair go. "I think it's going to have to be [delayed] unless it's sorted out by Friday, so let's see how Friday goes and I'm ever hopeful that we'll have a decision straight away, we'll have something that can tell us we can get back to where we have been. "But if it doesn't, if goes to Level 4 or level 3 and the rest of the country at level 2, I think we're going to have to look at it." ACT leader David Seymour wrote to the Speaker last night asking him to postpone the dissolution of Parliament. "Terrible news tonight. It occurs to me that Parliament does not need to dissolve before the election. "I strongly urge you to postpone the dissolution of Parliament tomorrow until at least this time next week when a clearer picture of the Public Health situation can be had. "It is possible that the election will now need to be delayed. If that is the case, I believe the people would want to have Parliament available for an epidemic response committee or perhaps sittings," Seymour said in the letter.

Photo: RNZ / Sarah Robson Auckland has gone into level 3 lockdown today for the next three days. As a result, political parties are rushing to cancel events both inside and outside the super city. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern said she would likely be based in Wellington for at least the next three days. Meanwhile, National has cancelled all of today's campaign events and leader Judith Collins said a lot of work would need to be done over the coming days to figure out exactly what this latest case of community transmission will mean for the country. "New Zealanders can be assured that National will be seeking an explanation and clear answers about the situation we now find ourselves in," she said. Collins called on New Zealanders to follow the advice of health officials and do their part to stamp out the latest case of Covid-19 community. See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19 New Zealand First leader Winston Peters was due to be campaigning in Levin and Masterton today, but Peters said "regrettably in these circumstances NZ First's campaign has been temporarily suspended". The Green Party has suspended in-person campaigning subject to health advice. And the ACT Party will meet today to discuss the future of its campaign. ACT leader David Seymour said there would be enough time to ask why this had happened later, but right now the goal was to get on top of it before there was loss of life or further loss of livelihoods. "As with the last lockdown, we all need to do the right thing to beat the virus as quickly as possible. "We also need the government to play an effective, transparent and competent role." Act leader David Seymour. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas Seymour said the government must be 100 percent open and transparent about all of the data, the options and the decision-making process. "We have to hope that the government has made real progress in its preparedness to test and trace, we cannot afford for the initial three days to turn into a lockdown without end," he said. Seymour wants the government to be more transparent about what is informing its alert level decision making. He says businesses in particular will be feeling extremely anxious right now, and the best antidote for that anxiety is certainty. "The government must bring New Zealanders into its confidence and treat us as adults by telling us what decisions it will be making and how it will be making them. "What information does it require to come out of this level 3 and 2 respectively by Friday, because New Zealand businesses and households as they plan their futures right now cannot afford a rolling maul of surprises", he said. Seymour says if the lockdown lasts beyond Friday the focus must urgently turn to mitigating the economic impacts. He says any wage subsidy would need to be more tailored than during the last lockdown, and it would be vital to allow green grocers and butchers to open. He says it is also important that non-Covid medical needs, such as cancer screening, do not fall by the wayside. The government has given itself a "three day challenge" to prove that its contact tracing is up to gold standard, he says. While he is hopeful rapid contact tracing would ensure that restrictions could be lifted after Friday, he thinks it is going to "be heroic". Seymour says if level 3, or even level 2 restrictions remain in place beyond Friday, the general election should be delayed. "Your meetings are limited to 100 people and people are supposed to be two metres apart. You can't have anything like the kind of political meetings that ACT has been having for the last few months", he said. Seymour says it would not be a level playing field if Jacinda Ardern continues to front daily Covid press briefings and he believes she needs to take a step back and create more separation between her roles as incumbent prime minister and Labour leader.

National president Peter Goodfellow. Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas Newshub yesterday reported Bridge had been accused of calling NewstalkZB using an alias "Merv" in an attempt to undermine a National candidate for the Auckland Central seat. That candidate - Nuwanthie Samarakone - was unsuccessful in her bid to become the electorate's candidate, with party members picking Emma Mellow instead. Bridge has not responded to RNZ's calls, but denied he was the caller when questioned by Newshub outside Parliament. In a statement, National president Peter Goodfellow said the board was aware of the allegations. "The board will be meeting together as soon as possible so it can consider the matter." National leader Judith Collins told RNZ she understood the board was meeting on Tuesday. "I do not approve of this behaviour. It is not something I would do. I do not approve of it. It is now a matter for the board." Collins said she had not spoken to Bridge and would reserve any further comments for the board. "It is very important that I am being utterly focused on policy and the people of New Zealand," she said. "Outside the media, absolutely nobody cares about the internal workings of the National Party." Bridge is also the chairperson of the party's Canterbury Westland region. Speaking to RNZ earlier, National's Christchurch Central candidate Dale Stephens offered support to Bridge, describing him as "one of the most honourable men" he had met. "[The allegations] didn't make sense as Roger looks after the South Island," Stephens said. The Auckland Central seat became available after former National deputy Nikki Kaye announced last month she would retire from politics at the election.

Stephens declined to be interviewed further. A senior South Island National Party member says the call to Newstalk ZB was "strange" and noted the similarities in the voice. "It does sound like him," the member says. They say the Auckland Central candidacy has been "untidy" but believe the party's overall campaign is looking strong. The member also says the board does not have the power to elect candidates for the electorate. "The delegates make the decision, not the board," the member says. They say the issue has not been raised within National Party circles in the South Island on Tuesday.

"We're lucky to have some of the most beautiful landscapes and wildlife in the world. The establishment of new National Parks and the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary will protect and improve our biodiversity while ensuring more Kiwis get to experience our natural environment." The party says it would also update the 1993 Tahr management plan to "ensure it balances environmental needs with commercial and recreational hunting opportunities". "National knows that recreation is at the heart of our conservation estate," the party's conservation spokesperson Jacqui Dean says. "We will ensure New Zealanders are able to continue to enjoy access to recreational fishing, whitebaiting and hunting. "National will take a balanced, long-term and pragmatic approach to conservation to ensure that all New Zealanders - both here today and future generations - will have the opportunity to experience and enjoy our incredible natural environment." The party also committed to ensuring commercial fishing stocks are managed sustainably, so recreational fishers are not adversely impacted.

Tabuteau said they would receive funding for landscaping, building repairs, electrical wiring, plumbing and painting work which was expected to create 133 jobs. "That's a good way to invest your tax-payer money, to reinvigorate the communities, make sure there are jobs, make sure there's literally money moving through your communities so that those technicians, those electricians, those carpenters can put kai on their tables," he said.

Photo: RNZ / Tom Kitchin Juanita Cotter from Rangihua marae said they would receive $50,000 in funding in order to restore the amo, or sides of the wharenui (meeting house) that hold up the maihi (front of the meeting house). She said they are also doing up the heke (rafters of the wharenui) and the tukutuku panels, which have not been done up for over 40 years. "I'm really rapt that we - and all the marae - got this fund because otherwise we wouldn't be able to do it, so we depend on funding like this to do jobs, especially these big jobs and I was rapt - I'm so rapt that all the marae have this opportunity." Miriama Hammond hopes the renovations may bring rangitahi back home.

"I think it's going to be exciting for our marae and it's going to be helpful to bring back, maybe our young ones, so that they can become involved in the marae." Sarah Paku says it will be great to have strong, dry serviceable marae. Photo: RNZ / Tom Kitchin Ngti Kahungunu ki Wairoa general manager Sarah Paku said some of the marae were in a state of disrepair, with leaky rooves, and electrical systems that were so old they needed to be completely redone. She said getting this repair work done would be huge for her people. "Our marae are our centre of our universe so if they're strong, if they're dry, if they're serviceable, it's going to be great for our people." The funding for the marae renovations comes from a $70m fund earmarked in May for the purpose of doing up public spaces like marae, town halls and Pasifika churches.

National entices voters with big infrastructure projects, Judith Collins rips into Jacinda Ardern and Parliament passes a bill that could affect every tenant in the country. From top left: Jacinda Ardern, Winston Peters, Alfred Ngaro and Judith Collins all featured as Parliament wrapped up before the election campaign begins. Photo: Getty Images / RNZ During a hectic week in politics the campaign strategies of the main parties were revealed. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, having previously said that her party wasn't going to release the usual comprehensive policy manifesto, was asked at her post-Cabinet press conference on Monday if that meant the country was in for "a Covid election". She replied: "Yes, you're right, Covid will pre-determine a lot of what we debate this election. But voters still have a choice to make as to whether or not they continue with the plan that we have pitched or whether or not they choose to stop and move on to an alternate programme." That said a lot about the government's intentions. Ardern may try to keep the focus on Covid-19 through to Election Day, relying on confidence among voters that it is doing a good job and that they won't want to risk putting anyone else in charge of a strategy that's keeping the virus out the country. The government's economic recovery plan had been set out, Ardern explained, and because Covid-19 was going to be around for quite a while its policies and actions would mainly revolve around keeping New Zealanders safe. Faced with that tactic, National's leader Judith Collins scorned Labour. "What we're seeing from Labour is no policies at all. Hiding away is never a way to win an election," she said. During the adjournment debate in Parliament on Thursday she explained how her campaign was going to work: "This election is going to be about who is going to be best able to manage what has been described by the Reserve Bank as the biggest economic downturn in 160 years." Collins told Morning Report her party was getting ready to roll out "a whole raft of policies". They wouldn't be announced all at once. "If we pop them out too early then the government, who don't seem to have any policies, will maybe just steal them." To show she's just as serious as Ardern when it comes to keeping people safe, Collins told Newstalk ZB National had a zero tolerance attitude to the virus. Under her watch "it simply would not be allowed in". She had a dig at the government over people escaping from managed isolation, and gave another firm assurance. "If we're in charge there wouldn't be people escaping," she said. "There's a lot of fear about Covid-19 coming across the border. I think every time someone escapes from quarantine it just makes people even more nervous." National isn't shy about policy announcements and made all the running this week, enticing voters with huge transport infrastructure projects. It released some of the allocations in the previously announced $31 billion spend-up, with $4b for Wellington, including $700 million for a second Mt Victoria tunnel on the route that has frustrated thousands of commuters for decades. That, and other projects to get rid of bottlenecks, are already part of Wellington City Council's plans under the title Let's Get Wellington Moving. The difference is that National is committing to actually start building the roads and tunnels. Then there was $1.1b for the Kpiti Coast to extend the expressway which would "free people from the tyranny of congestion and save lives," Collins said.

Newshub reported the party looked set to announce an extension of sick leave. MPs were coy about it but admitted it was being worked on. There's not much doubt it would be a popular move. Newshub said a UMR poll for the Council of Trade Unions showed 68 per cent of people wanted the five days to be increased and 53 per cent thought it should be doubled. In Parliament, the final act was the adjournment debate. It's usually an opportunity for party leaders to tear each other apart but Ardern didn't do that. Her benign speech listed numerous good things the government had done as it put 190 bills through the House, which she said was proof of its extraordinary unity and its ability to create consensus around legislation. Ardern made no mention of National's leader and the word "opposition" didn't pass her lips. Collins wasn't having any of that. She began by telling Ardern she was going to be more famous than she thought, because she was going to be the first one-term Labour prime minister since Bill Rowling. She trashed cabinet ministers Kelvin Davis and Phil Twyford, saying their rankings of two and four said a lot about the competence of Ardern's team. "What did we hear from the prime minister, the leader of the Labour Party - a whole lot of pixie dust and talk about how everything is going to be just fine," she said. Winston Peters took her on, describing her speech as "cant, carp and criticism with not a single policy." Collins didn't stay for the rest of it, hearing him say as she left the debating chamber: "Don't go now, this is your best chance to learn something." Parliament passed several bills during its final week. The most important and controversial was the Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill. It stops landlords kicking out tenants without cause under a 90-day notice, removes rental bidding and allows landlords to increase rents only once in a 12-month period. Tenancies can only be terminated for "fair and justified reasons" such as anti-social behaviour and repeated rent defaults. Associate Housing Minister Kris Faafoi said more New Zealanders than ever were renting and the old laws were outdated and out of balance. National's Alfred Ngaro described it as the "I hate landlords bill" and another, Andrew Bayly, warned it would lead to rent increases. He said most landlords were decent people and they were being punished because of a few bad ones. The result would be "mum and dad" landlords deciding not to rent out their properties, the market would shrink and prices would be pushed up. He could be right about rents. Stuff reported yesterday property managers were advising landlords to start issuing rent increase notices now. Bindi Norwell Photo: supplied The bill comes into force on 27 September, at the end of the Covid-19 rent freeze period. "We imagine a number of landlords will be issuing rent increases over the coming days and weeks," said Bindi Norwell, chief executive of the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ), which also represents property managers. "We have heard some landlords suggest that they may issue more significant rent increases as a result of changes in the legislation." She said: "We will be keeping a close eye on this." Norwell said REINZ welcomed the provision that landlords could only increase rent annually because it gave certainty to tenants who could better plan their finances. The TV debates between Ardern and Collins will be must watch events. They go head-to-head on TVNZ at 7pm on 25 August and again on 17 September, same channel same time. *Peter Wilson is a life member of Parliament's press gallery, 22 years as NZPA's political editor and seven as parliamentary bureau chief for NZ Newswire.

Analysis - Can we postpone this year's election? Quite frankly, the political parties don't seem ready for it, and aren't about to offer voters the necessary policy choices for the unprecedented times we're in. We've ended up with a campaign focused on scandal, personality and leadership, with a policy void that's worse than usual. Voters face a policy desert when choosing who to vote for, says Bryce Edwards. Photo: Supplied Most of the parties are failing to release much in the way of new policy. The justification for this is that the coronavirus crisis and the associated volatility means policymaking is too difficult or unnecessary. And yet it's this very crisis that makes fresh policies and a contest of ideas more vital than ever. Nonetheless, this week Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern warned Labour doesn't have much in the way of new policy to announce, saying "I would flag to voters not to expect to see the large scale manifestos that are a significant departure from what we are doing". According to this quote, in comparison to 2017 when Labour campaigned on introducing KiwiBuild, extending paid parental leave, and fees-free tertiary education, Ardern "suggested that new policy ideas on this type of scale were off the table for Labour this election." Finance Minister Grant Robertson has justified Labour's lack of a plan, saying "this is not a time to be making grand promises, when there is so much uncertainty in the world". Bryce Edwards. Photo: Twitter It's hard to see when would be a better time than right now to hear about how parties are going to deal with the new economic reality, and rebuilding both economy and society. Back in April I wrote in The Guardian that this would be a big policy-based election campaign with big bold policies being put forward. I wrote then, that "Politicians will need to provide voters with a compelling vision, backed by detailed policies, for rebuilding the country. Recreating the old order won't be good enough." How wrong - or blinded by wishful thinking - I was. Reaction to Labour's policy-free approach to the election is swiftly building. Newsroom editor Bernard Hickey has published a searing criticism of Ardern for taking what he sees as a conservative strategy to the election when transformation is required. Hickey reports the PM's post-Cabinet press conference confirmation of Labour's conservative approach: "She confirmed Labour had no plans for major new spending or tax or welfare reform in the last full post-Cabinet news conference of her first term. Instead, voters should look at the Government's current achievements, its plans for Covid-19 recovery and Budget 2020's debt track as an indicator of 'steady-as-she-goes'. There is no more. That is it. After months of wondering if she was about to flex her new and larger political muscles to pull a big policy rabbit out of the hat, she tapped the hat, turned it upside down, asked us to peer inside at the emptiness, and put it back down on the table: a popular magician without a trick who doesn't harm rabbits." Hickey explains the electoral pragmatism behind the conservative strategy: "In political circles, it is known as the 'low target' strategy: offer little obvious change from the status quo to give your opponent few clear pain points to target you on the grounds you want to 'hurt' one part of the electorate or another. It is essentially a conservative strategy, often employed by conservative parties in government. This week Jacinda Ardern revealed herself as a small 'c' conservative, focused on maintaining the current shape and (historically and comparatively small) size of government, but with a friendlier face." Labour's approach is, of course, being celebrated by some. Conservative political commentator Liam Hehir writes today that his side can essentially claim Ardern as one of their own, and he celebrates Ardern's lack of interest in advocating a transformative agenda. According to Hehir, Ardern's lack of focus on policy and her status quo-orientated politics of kindness are actually a good thing, and it's why conservatives like himself are comfortable with this government, especially since they want to retain so many of the settings of the last National government. On the left, some are less impressed about the lack of differentiation or advocacy for reform. The normally pro-government blogsite, The Standard, has published a critique of the failure of the various parties to rise to the occasion, asking: "Why have we fallen into the most boring and predictable election we've had since Bolger's second term? Neither National nor Labour have put out fresh policy in months. New roads don't count as fresh anything. Nor do medium-scale regional projects". The post says the public deserve more than vacuous slogans like "Let's keep moving" and what they represent, arguing "there is zero sense of urgency from either side of the political spectrum". But it doesn't have to be like this: "In most previous governments, there would have been a huge national call to arms, with summits and unified departmental purposes, and seriously bold policy initiatives, and at the end of which everyone knew that there was a plan, they were part of a team working on that plan, and they could get up in the morning and know how they were assisting that team with their effort. There's no plan at all, other than: print money and stay disinfected." Labour's policy-free approach was also discussed yesterday in a Stuff editorial, which highlighted a letter to the editor that said: "Ahead of a general election, voters need to see policy, and they need a clear plan. Otherwise, how are we to make a sound choice?" The editorial agreed that Labour's policy-light approach could be seen as arrogant or presumptuous, as it looks like the popular party is attempting to get re-elected without the scrutiny of a contest of ideas taking place. It also endorses Ardern's argument "that her party's priority is the Covid-19 recovery, and that trumps significant new policy". The news outlet says it's fair enough for Labour to focus on "bedding in the successes" and preventing Covid outbreaks. What's more, "Managing the pandemic response means regular policy announcements anyway, just not according to an election campaign schedule." The editorial draws a parallel with Joe Biden's current campaign for the US presidency, which is also "without major splashes on the policy front". This is a point made by Newstalk ZB's Heather du Plessis-Allan: "Joe Biden seems to poll better when he's invisible. The idea of him is better than the reality of him. The less he's in the media, the better he does. It's looking like Labour might try to pull the same thing here. They're running an invisible campaign: hardly any policy, hardly any typical campaign media stuff, almost trying to pretend the campaign isn't happening". Du Plessis-Allan criticises Labour for not telling us how they will deal with the crisis: "If you're hoping to get an idea of how they're going to get us out of this economic hole before you vote, judging by that comment, you're going to be disappointed. Furthermore, the PM's not participating in the regular media interviews you'd expect during a campaign." She argues Labour's policy-free approach is masked by the party's emphasis on the health crisis. So, is the government milking Covid instead of devising and selling new policy? That's the argument of fellow broadcaster Kate Hawkesby, who says politicians are cynically forgoing policy messaging and going down the easier and more productive route of ramping up a focus on the virus and Labour's success in dealing with it: "Labour has seen what Covid has done for them, and they're running with it. Forget policy, forget issues, forget future plans, as long as they can keep reminding us to wash our hands, it keeps us in a state of fear". Similarly, Barry Soper says this election campaign is reminiscent of Labour's policy-free re-election campaign of 1987: "In the run-up to that campaign the country was also in a state of shock, it had been dragged out of the Muldoon economic ice box with the promise from Roger Douglas of short-term pain for long-term gain". He points out that, back then, the party rode a wave of popularity and won by a landslide, but were severely punished at the following election. However, it's not just a problem with Labour. Richard Harman of the Politik website has detailed National's policy drought, saying "political professionals are surprised that the party is only starting to develop its policy seven weeks out from the election. The party does have a new policy website which has 14 infrastructure policies (all transport projects) three long-standing education policies and nothing else". Harman explains how policy development has chaotically evolved over this year: "National had been developing a series of policy discussion documents under the leadership of Nelson MP, Nick Smith. These were posted on the party's website, but at the start of the Covid lockdown, they were taken down, apparently at the direction of then-leader, Simon Bridges. When Todd Muller replaced Bridges in May, Amy Adams was appointed to head up a series of policy development teams. Politik understands Adams' teams have yet to produce any policy and what policy the party has produced has come from the campaign director, Tim Hurdle." National is heavily pushing its slogan about jobs and the economy. But according to Duncan Garner the public requires more than that: "Saying 'jobs' and 'economy' doesn't make anything happen. We need to see your plans and ideas - now". Here's Garner's wider point: "There is drought on new policy from both parties. I'm not voting on how well Ardern handled the crisis, that's now banked. I want to know what these parties are offering for the next three years. Labour, are you going to tax us more to pay for the cost of Covid? National, if you're going to spend less - what goes? Enough about yourselves, what about us? I can barely name a policy anyone has put out in recent weeks, and in 66 days we go to the polls." Of course, it's not easy in the current volatile environment to come up with policy solutions. This is emphasised by Interest's Jene Tibshraeny: "Creating policy in response to a pandemic and recession is of course a mammoth task - especially for broad-based parties like National and Labour. What's more, the situation with the virus is evolving, making it difficult to look too far ahead. Parties would be foolish to set too much in stone, when they need to be agile". Tibshraeny points out that the Greens and Act are coming up with some detailed policy, but she suspects the other parties are simply "too afraid of alienating voters by tackling the issues facing the country in this new Covid era". She warns against allowing any party to treat "the election as an inconvenience to its God-given right to govern" and concludes "We need to demand a realistic contest of ideas from our leaders." But are the public actually interested in policy detail? The Greens have put out a 52-page election manifesto, which leftwing blogger Martyn Bradbury has poked fun at: "Only the biggest politics geek with an enormous luxury of time or the most fastidious Green Party follower who recycles their own body waste is going to read all 52 pages. Sure there are some great ideas amongst all this, but the point is to sell those ideas in easy bite sized chunks, subsection 5A -with 12 point KPIs will sail over the heads of 95 percent of the electorate" Finally, political journalist Thomas Coughlan says "the current paucity of election policy is something of a scandal", as is the propensity of governments to farm out policy questions to working groups and experts. He looks for solutions to the problem. * Dr Bryce Edwards is Political Analyst in Residence at Victoria University of Wellington. He is the director of the Democracy Project.

Auckland airport. Photo: RNZ / Liu Chen As a Kiwi student who happened to move to Sweden to study last year, I'm thrilled the government has acknowledged that it is unfair to charge New Zealanders currently overseas for their managed isolation or quarantine (MIQ) when returning home. According to the significant legislation rushed through the House, charges would instead fall on those visiting New Zealand for less than 90 days, or leaving the country for any duration from 10 August and then returning. Megan Woods - the minister in charge of managed isolation - has suggested arrangements would be made for those unable to pay upfront, and there would be exemptions for various groups including people travelling for compassionate reasons, diplomats and refugees. But the new law falls short of the kind of comprehensive and caring public health response that made me so proud to be a Kiwi when the country sacrificed heaps by being kind, staying home and saving lives. Firstly, the legislated MIQ (managed isolation and quarantine) fees system will put bureaucracy in the way of compassion. Regardless of whether a more prescriptive approach is taken or whether higher weighting is assigned to case-by-case assessments, drawing lines in the sand on fee waivers will be horrifically difficult. There's something heartless about needing to explain, say, how likely it is you or a relative will die before you are exempt from a $3100 baseline charge which has the potential to majorly set you back. Consider the daughter in the UK with stage three cancer who wants her New Zealand parents to be able to travel and care for her if it gets worse. What about if the cancer was "only" stage two? The blurry lines don't stop there. How about virtually every other conceivable situation of family reunification that doesn't involve provable imminent death? Is it compassionate to charge older grandparent(s) thousands of dollars on top of airfares to visit their grandkids for the first, maybe only, time? Is it really fair to slap an extra fee on a parent using up all their annual leave to spend a couple cherished weeks with their kid (keeping in mind two weeks of that leave is necessarily lost to quarantine)? These are not hypotheticals; in the Team of Six Million Facebook group, which opposes all quarantine fees, you will find countless such realities. Human lives and travel needs have never done well fitting into limited, swiftly-imposed categories and the proposed regime, which strongly suggests compassion will be the exception rather than the rule, is set to designate such divides. Regulations in line with the bill would see MBIE and "relevant ministers" playing God with exemption status, and to our shame, we'll have to pay for them to do it. Secondly, Woods, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and the Green Party have acknowledged that the yardstick for deciding on who pays for quarantine is fairness. This sounds great at first. According to this line of thinking, it doesn't especially matter how little the system earns, as long as it is fair. Indeed, projections are that the proposed scheme will defray less than $10 million even if $600,000 in administration costs are not factored in, while the forecast MIQ budget for 2020 is $479m. Clearly, we are talking about perceived fairness above financial benefit. The problem is it is ridiculously difficult to decide on any kind of fee scheme that is, in fact, fair, because every trip comes with its own unique set of individual circumstances. Placing this burden on tangata whenua feels to me like one more unjust act of colonisation. Charging quarantine at both ends of many New Zealand-Australia trips also hardly seems equitable. If that weren't enough, under current eligibility regulations, it would severely curtail the capacity of New Zealand citizens and permanent residents living overseas to vote. I'd rather see the government use its time and resources to strengthen a system which stands proudly behind public health as a public good, repeal its MIQ fees legislation which has been rushed through without public consultation, and focus squarely on keeping New Zealand communities Covid-free. Third, while the government's efforts to reach sufficient levels of agreement to move forward within its own ranks are at least constructive, it is to New Zealand's shame that the issue ever became the fraught and polarising topic it did, from Twitter threads to the halls of Parliament. All parties except ACT voted for the legislation, but National and New Zealand First have continued indicating it does not go far enough, which is particularly concerning in light of the upcoming election. Back in early May, New Zealand researchers warned us that the sense of social cohesion in the country would not miraculously maintain itself now, despite being very strong in the country's early response to Covid-19. "The challenges will rise as the country begins to transition out of the acute phase," they wrote. "Once social cohesion is lost, it becomes extremely difficult to restore, especially when there is both increased uncertainty and new forms of inequality." The beautiful sense of unity in April with the teddy bears in the windows, the daily Jacinda and Ashley presser ritual, and calling the whnau over Zoom to beat the isolation was no accident. It was the result of intentionally, diligently focusing on a nationally important goal and working together to achieve it. Let's now focus on keeping New Zealand communities Covid-free while showing compassion to all of our fellow Kiwis and their families. * ine Kelly-Costello is a journalist and campaigner from Aotearoa completing her masters from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers The referendum asks voters if they support the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill, which would make recreational cannabis legal to consume in some circumstances. Collins told RNZ's Checkpoint all the party's caucus would vote no in the referendum, on the basis it was "recreational cannabis, sale and use". "It is not medicinal cannabis as some people have been misled to thinking. It is absolutely not something that people who care about the mental health of New Zealanders should be setting up a decision that tells yonger people in particular that this is something that won't do you any harm," she said. The whole National Party caucus had agreed on the decision, and it was not a "captain's call", Collins said. Labour does not have an official policy on the referendum, but its justice spokesperson Andrew Little and former health spokesperson David Clark have said they would vote for legalisation. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern is maintaining her silence on recreational cannabis, rebuffing National's challenge for her to say how she'll vote in this year's referendum. Collins threw down the gauntlet on the campaign trail this morning, demanding Ardern be upfront about her position. "This is a very crucial vote for people. New Zealanders need to know where the prime minister stands on this," Collins said. "It shouldn't be that big a deal for her, should it?" Ardern has repeatedly declined to reveal which way she'll vote in the cannabis referendum, saying the decision ultimately lies with the public. Asked again on Tuesday, Ardern stuck to that position. "My vote I see as good as my neighbour's vote and equal to theirs," she said. "I do want to be able to maintain the position that should people vote in favour or oppose, that I can then be seen to objectively facilitate that happening." Collins told reporters it was "absolute codswallop" for Ardern to try keep her position quiet. "For goodness' sake, you wouldn't let me get away with that one, would you?" The National Party opposed recreational cannabis "very strongly" due in part to concerns about mental health, Collins said. "We have seen the effects of recreational cannabis use on people, particularly those under the age of 26 whose brains are still growing," she said. The prime minister's chief science adviser Juliet Gerrard published a report last month which found legalising recreational cannabis would significantly improve police bias against Mori and lead to a weakened illegal market, thereby reducing social harms.

National Party leader Judith Collins and justice spokesperson Simon Bridges, left, announcing the party's law and order policy. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers Party leader Judith Collins said National's just-released law and order policies will make New Zealand a safe place to live and work. "Our policy is simple: Victims should get justice and criminals should be held accountable for the harm they cause, while also being rehabilitated into contributing members of our society," Collins said. If elected, National would give the police greater powers to search the homes and cars of gang members for guns, introduce tougher sentences for gang-related crime and ban all gang insignia in public places. It would also introduce a new aggravating factor in the Sentencing Act that would mean a judge would consider someone's offending while being a gang member, or in association with gang members and/or a gang, as well as changing the onus of proof on gang-related income which would mean anyone on the national gang list would need to prove their income came from a legitimate source. National's justice spokesperson Simon Bridges said the party will support the police to disrupt and halt the operations' of gangs across the country. "National will respond to the communities' concerns about the ability of gangs to intimidate the public by banning all gang insignia in public places," Bridges said. The party would also amend the Arms Act and make another government agency responsible for administering the law, not the police. Mental health facilities in policing would be expanded, funding and resourcing for the Independent Police Conduct Authority would be increased and more police would be deployed in rural areas. National also wants to introduce Firearm Prohibition Orders and provide clear rules around the regulation of clubs and ranges, and provide "common sense" exemptions for pest control operations, sports shooting, and collectors. It would also implement a new initiative - Clean Start - which would support recently-released prisoners to move away from where they committed the crime they were imprisoned for. Corrections would work with community providers who have experience in delivering rehabilitation support to deliver the progamme that builds on the 'Out of the Gate' scheme started by the previous National government.

The Kpiti Gateway Centre would be built at the northern end of Maclean Park at Paraparaumu Beach (pictured). Photo: Wikimedia Commons The government has announced more than $2 million through the Covid-19 Response and Recovery fund for the Kpiti Gateway building at Paraparaumu Beach - covering about half of the overall cost. But one of the two Kpiti Island tour operators claimed it could devastate his business. The Kpiti Gateway would be built at the northern end of Maclean Park at Paraparaumu Beach. Under the project about 17 parks would be removed and a new visitor centre and biosecurity centre for Kpiti Island tours would be built. The project also includes improvements to Tikotu Stream, a new bridge and story telling of the area's history. Paraparaumu Beach Business Association chairperson Sharon Hunter said she was not opposed to having a building there, but was unhappy with how the Kpiti Coast District Council handled the process.

Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver "People have been speaking about putting something here at the beach for a really long time, but this particular project they have only been talking about that for the last few months and the community hasn't been involved," she said. Hunter also questioned the size and ongoing costs to ratepayers for the upkeep of the facilities. Business owners were also upset with food and retail containers being included in the proposed plan, she said. "We always requested no competing businesses to be in this proposed building," she said. Owner of nearby Lotto and knitting shop, Paula McKeown, voiced similar concerns. "Paraparaumu Beach has so many cafes and so many eateries that we just don't need another one," she said. Glen Cooper - who owns Kpiti Island Eco tours with his wife Vicky - was worried that they would be forced to use the biosecurity centre and have to pay user charges, contrary to what they had been originally told. "Through an Official Information Act request we have now found out that there is documentation floating around the council stating $10 and $5 a child, that will devastate our business," he said. Cooper said a report in 2014 showed that raising fees could lead to a decrease in visitor numbers. He was also sceptical of the possible visitor numbers laid out in the feasibility report. In the feasibility report it was stated that current numbers accessing Kpiti Island were sitting at around 15,000 visitors annually. "The current availability of 160 concessions available per day takes annual capacity to almost 58,000 visitors a year," the report said. "Therefore, biosecurity compliance activities housed within the space would need to be able to process 160 people in 90 minutes to coincide with the current peak commercial operator departures to the island." However, Cooper said due to weather conditions, the seasonal nature of the tours and island permits, 58,000 visitors would not be possible. Kpiti Mayor K Gurunathan. Photo: RNZ / Richard Tindiller Kpiti Mayor K Gurunathan said the application was pushed through because the council was running out of time to get in the application, especially with time lost due to Covid-19. "I can understand the angst that comes out of that, but having said that, now we have secured the funding we on our part have got more than $2 million to put into our long term plan funding process for this project," he said. A range of options for the containers will be discussed, not just food and beverage, such as bike sheds, he said. He added that the council was also ironing out concerns with the Coopers and would speak with other stakeholders. "We will be looking at their business case, because the last thing we want is to undermine the very businesses we say this project is going to be supporting," he said. No final decision had been made on the project, Gurunathan said. The project was estimated to create 27 jobs in the design and build phase, and up to 72 in the longer term. Infrastructure Minister Shane Jones said there was an expectation that projects were shovel ready and there was action within 12 months. "I'd just say to the council, engage with the officials, don't alienate the ratepayers and if there has to be a pragmatic solution, then find one," he said. Meanwhile, Crown Infrastructure Partners Ltd, which handled the Response and Recovery fund applications, said although the project had been announced, negotiations were still underway. "All announcements have been made in principle and subject to these contract negotiations, investment values are also subject to change," it said. The council is expected to meet this week to discuss the future of the project.

National's Auckland Central candidate Emma Mellow Photo: SUPPLIED/ National Party National Party members met tonight in Auckland to decide who should take the spot left vacant last month by former deputy leader Nikki Kaye. Mellow will be up against Labour's Helen White, the Green's Chloe Swarbrick, and TOP's Tuariki Delamere. National Party said in a statement that Mellow, 30, is a senior communications manager for ANZ Bank. Mellow said she would be "hitting the campaign trail hard" in the lead up to the election. She would be travelling to Waiheke and Great Barrier and campaigning in Auckland Central, planning to meet as many people as possible ahead of the election. "Auckland Central has had strong National representation for 12 years and I will be fighting hard to make sure it continues to have strong National representation. "Our community, like the rest of the country, is worried about the future. What our economy will look like, whether they will have a job and how they will support their family. "They certainly don't need tax increases adding any more pressure on their household budget. But that is exactly what Labour and the Greens will do, adding a wealth tax on hard-working New Zealanders, going after their income, their house and their KiwiSaver. She said National was focussed on supporting Aucklanders and their livelihoods, helping people start businesses and backing existing businesses to hire more staff. "Only National has the economic experience, the competence and the vision to rescue the economy, save businesses and protect jobs." Mellow grew up in One Tree Hill and attended St Cuthbert's College. She is a qualified volunteer surf life saver and in her spare time enjoys running, ocean swimming and cooking.

ACT leader David Seymour. Photo: RNZ / Jogai Bhatt Like her predecessors, Collins is asking National supporters in the Auckland electorate to give their vote to Seymour, rather than National's candidate, Paul Goldsmith. "I'm very happy to say that we want the party vote - please - in Epsom and in this particular electorate, you can give the first tick for the electorate to David Seymour," Collins says. "I think he's a very good local MP and I would welcome him being part of a National-ACT government." Seymour has been the party's lone MP since 2014 - winning the Epsom seat, but failing to get enough of the party vote to bring anyone else into Parliament. He says he has proven himself as a good local MP and it is up to the people of Epsom to decide who will represent them. He's also not turning his nose up at Collins' backing. "It would be churlish for me to turn off any endorsement, so I'm always grateful encouraging others to vote for me," Seymour says. Today, ACT kicked off its nationwide bus tour, which will make 70 stops up and down the country over the next six weeks. Onboard the ACT Party campaign bus. Photo: RNZ / Sarah Robson Seymour does not think he will have to change his pitch to voters when he heads to the provinces. "Voters in Epsom and voters everywhere have the same basic concern - how do we secure our future economically, without indebting future generations?" Recent polls have put support for ACT anywhere between 3 and 5 percent - giving it up to six MPs. After two terms as the party's sole MP, Seymour says he is up to the task of keeping a caucus in line. That will be helped by the quality of his team, he says. Deputy leader Brooke van Velden played an instrumental role in getting David Seymour's End of Life Choice bill across the line in parliament - which voters will get the final say on in a referendum on election day. David Seymour and Brooke van Velden Photo: RNZ / Sarah Robson Gun lobbyist Nicole McKee - a vocal opponent of the coalition government's changes to firearms laws in response to the Christchurch mosque shootings - is number three on ACT's list. Seymour was the only MP to vote against the first tranche of those reforms, but he doesn't think ACT risks getting captured by special interest groups. "We've never taken a position that you can't draw a straight line back to pure principle, whether it be free speech, fair firearm laws, our constructive and consistent approach to the epidemic response committee, End of Life Choice, partnership schools. "With ACT it's always been about principle, sometimes to our political cost." Former United Future leader, Peter Dunne, knows better than most how hard it can be to keep a caucus of divergent interests together and said there was a risk ACT could follow the same fate as United Future in the mid-2000s, when it ended up split between a conservative Christian faction and its more moderate, centrist supporters. Peter Dunne. Photo: RNZ "The important thing is to try and get the team together and focused on the team's objectives, rather than the special interests or the pet projects of individuals," Dunne says. "If you get caught by the latter, you're in trouble. In David's case, I think he's really got to say 'look, this is what ACT's about, these are our core messages, we've got to fit all of our approaches into those core messages otherwise it could fly apart very quickly." The last time ACT had more than one MP in Parliament was 2008.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423182/taranaki-s-tui-oil-field-survey-request-shows-split-pipe|2020-08-10|A tender for underwater inspection services at the abandoned Tui Oil Field off the coast of Taranaki has shed light on the dubious state of its subsea infrastructure. Tui's wells are connected to the floating production station Umuroa - which is still carrying about 30,000 barrels of oil - via flexible flowlines. Photo: Tamarind Resources It describes and includes dramatic pictures of a 10 to 12 metre split in an underwater flowline - blamed for an oil spill in November - and highlights other well integrity issues. Former Tui operator Tamarind Taranaki went bust late last year after an unsuccessful drilling campaign and owes creditors more than $300 million. The Crown now owns Tui and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is overseeing decommissioning the field at a cost of about $140m to the taxpayer. Tui's wells are connected to the floating production station Umuroa - which is still carrying about 30,000 barrels of oil - via flexible flowlines. An undersea inspection following last year's raised concerns and MBIE wants to take a closer look before progressing with the decommissioning process. Photo: Supplied Climate Justice Taranaki researcher Catherine Cheung said she was horrified when she saw the tender. "It's describing damaged flowlines with blisters and splits with oil marks on at least one of them. We just don't know how integral, how strong the infrastructure is down there." Cheung could not understand how the infrastructure could have got into this state in the first place. "We just wonder whether WorkSafe or the Environmental Protection Authority, do they have the confidence that have they been monitoring the activities in the Exclusive Economic Zone? "These companies, the things they do out there, does the government know? Our regulators, are they on top of it? Or are we leaving things too late now that the companies are gone and we are left with this mess?" Damage to the Tui 2H Flowline. Photo: Supplied Salt Ecology is a consultancy which specialises in monitoring and evaluating the impact of activities - including oil and gas operations - on the marine environment. Its senior scientist Leigh Stevens said it was worrying that a flowline had split. "From an environmental perspective it's certainly a concern that there has been a rupture in a pipe and if it's through fatigue or something of that nature then you would hope there were monitoring procedures in place that would pick that up in advance. "The general absence of spills from corrosion and things in the marine oil industry generally shows that by and large [monitoring procedures are] pretty robust." Stevens said blistering did not necessarily mean a pipe was about to fail, but he warned Taranaki oil had a high wax content, floated easily and would head straight to the shore if spilled. He was more concerned the taxpayer was paying for the decommissioning of Tui. "One thing that I am amazed at is the fact that we seem to put a lot of political effort into encouraging oil companies - or we have done historically - encouraged oil companies to come and explore and develop, and then we seem to be quite happy to let them cry bankruptcy and run away." MBIE tender picture showing damage to the Tui 2H Flowline blamed for November's oil spill. Photo: Supplied In a statement, an MBIE spokesperson said it had sought advice from Petrofac, a company that specialises in the operation and decommissioning of petroleum facilities, about the status of the Tui assets and it recommended another underwater survey be done. This survey would allow MBIE to plan sensibly for the environmental consents needed for the project. "The purpose of the upcoming underwater survey is to assess the integrity of subsea flexible flowlines to ensure flushing flowlines can be safely carried out before the FPSO Umuroa disconnects and leaves the field. The damage needs to be studied before any assessment can be made." The spokesperson said the Crown was committed to complying with all environmental protection standards and other regulatory requirements in its management of the Tui oil field. It believed the current state of the subsea infrastructure posed little risk, the spokesperson said. "While the flowlines are not in use and remain attached to the Umuroa, they are not expected to leak, and related decommissioning activity is not considered urgent. The flowlines contain 98 percent water and pose a negligible risk to the environment given production has ceased." Responsibility for regulation of oil and gas company infrastructure is shared between the Environmental Protection Authority, Maritime NZ and WorkSafe. Photo: Supplied EPA general manager for compliance, monitoring and enforcement, Gayle Holmes, said it had inspected the Umuroa four times between 2014 and 2019 to monitor compliance with the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Act 2012 (EEZ Act) associated regulations and consent conditions. The authority also reviewed a subsea survey carried out by Tamarind Taranaki in 2018. "This did not identify signs of deterioration or faults to do with widespread blistering of flowlines," Holmes said. WorkSafe NZ spokesperson said the Tui Oil Field was subject to a periodic survey regime which was the responsibility of the operator. Following the last survey, prior to the spill, there were no apparent defects reported to WorkSafe. "The residual contents of the flow line present minimal health and safety risk, but may have a potential environmental impact. Environmental concerns are the responsibility of the EPA," the WorkSafe spokesperson said. Maritime NZ said its role was to ensure there was a marine oil spill contingency plan in place should there be a leak, and financial security to cover its costs. It said it was satisfied with the plan and security provided by BW Offshore - the owner of the Umuroa - and others involved. MBIE said the underwater survey work was anticipated to start early this month.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423175/cook-islands-bubble-sending-mixed-messages-collins|2020-08-10|National Party leader Judith Collins says the government needs to explain what would have changed between now and the end of the year, when a Cook Islands bubble is expected to be ready. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers Collins' media stand-up followed one by Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, who spoke about the possibility of a travel bubble with the Cook Islands. Ardern said she expected there to be a travel bubble in place by the end of the year. Officials will be on the ground in the next 10 days to start planning. Collins said the announcement was interesting timing and any travel bubble would have to be safe. She said the government needed to explain why it had chosen the end of the year. "What I can't understand is quite what's the difference between say October and December. It is saying it's going to take them that long to do anything, is it going to take them that long to decide?" "It's a very strange announcement to have right now, in the middle of an election campaign, to say they're thinking about having an announcement for something happening in December." She said the Cook Islands was the obvious place to start, but the government was sending mixed messages. "On the one hand you've got Ashley Bloomfield as the Director-General of Health starting to talk about Covid level 2 and also face masks, and on the other hand you've got now the government saying that maybe by december it'll be safe to have a travel bubble with the Cook Islands. "What's going to be different between now and December, I would like them to front up the details on it." "It sounds very odd. I don't know what's changed and I think they should explain it." She said it was important to take the advice of medical experts. Collins also asked the people of Epsom to give National the party vote and ACT leader David Seymour the local electorate vote. She said Seymour had shown "principle" in Parliament and National was open to working with him. National has historically supported ACT's bid for the electorate, but recent polls have National about 20 percentage points behind Labour. Meanwhile, ACT has seen a surge in support with One News Colmar Brunton poll placing the party at 5 percent. Third on the party list and finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith is National's Epsom candidate. Collins says everybody knows she and Seymour work well together. "I am very happy to say that we want the party vote please in Epsom please and in this particular electorate you can give the first tick for the electorate to David Seymour. "I think he is a very good local MP and I would welcome him being part of a National-ACT government," she said. Collins added that a National-led government will be best served with ACT as its partner. Earlier today the National Party said it would require drivers to display insurance details on their windscreens. Vehicles that don't have, as a minimum, third party car insurance would have to have the word 'uninsured' displayed on the registration label "If anyone was involved in an accident with you, you could literally walk over and see who their insurer was," Collins said.

Ministerial Services reviewed all his expenditure, including staff and spouse expenses, from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2020. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says she commissioned the review "to ensure taxpayer money was not inappropriately used in the course of his relationship, and the report has found none was". "Following this report, but also Iain Lees-Galloway's exit from Parliament, I consider the matter now closed," Ardern says.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423167/covid-19-nz-travel-bubble-with-cook-islands-could-be-in-place-by-end-of-year-ardern|2020-08-10|Labour leader Jacinda Ardern says she expects an update in the next two weeks on the timing of a Cook Islands and New Zealand travel bubble. Watch the conference here: In a press conference this afternoon, Ardern says Cabinet considered a draft text for the basis of an agreement. The next phase will be a verification phase on both sides within the next 10 days, she says. She says the draft text is nearing its conclusion and they're hoping the travel bubble will be in place before the end of the year. Two factors are the maritime and aviation border, and that will be a "significant part" of the verification phase, she says. "Those who would legally be able to be in New Zealand would be eligible but if they're not New Zealand citizens, they may need to go through an extra phase," she says, citing visa processes on the Cook Islands. "I expect in the next 10 days or so undertaking that on-the-ground verification process ... it is not a simple exercise and it is one where we are exercising caution." "The whole point of establishing this regime is the assurance that both the Cook Islands and New Zealand are considered to be Covid-free, but that doesn't mean we won't have extra stages of assurance." Ardern says New Zealand is still waiting on Niue to be ready for a potential travel bubble but at the moment the plan is just for the Cook Islands. "We have to base this on a public health decision which is what we're doing." Health declarations are the kind of initiatives being looked at as extra layers of assurance at the border for travellers, she says. "We have already been supporting the Cook Islands through this period, we are moving as quickly as we safely can on these arrangements... we are keeping up that dialogue with the Cook Islands administration." She says the foundation work for a trans-Tasman travel arrangement is also still under way but that it is still a way off. "Those airports that might be part of those arrangements will need to have the sign off from health that they can undertake quarantine-free travel safely ... we will need to make sure that we're assured that it's safe." Ardern says the Cook Islands utilises New Zealand's Covid-19 lab testing capacity. Talking about a trans-Tasman bubble, she says quarantine-free travel with others at this stage is not a reality for now. "I think there's a really good understanding within our own domestic tourism industry it's beneficial for our domestic tourism operators if we have New Zealanders travelling and enjoying New Zealand, but at the same time there's absolute understanding that if all the public health measures are in place, protecting New Zealand's domestic tourism industry is not a reason to stop people with NZ passports being able to travel between the Cook Islands and New Zealand." Business groups and some Pacific countries, including the Cook Islands, have been urging the New Zealand government to open travel with some parts of the region. The Cook Islands Chamber of Commerce said the country risked losing many young people to New Zealand if a safe travel corridor was not opened soon. Chamber president Fletcher Melvin said tourism accounted for 85 percent of the Cook Islands GDP last year, an industry that had evaporated with the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, both Auckland and Wellington airports last week said they had sketched out their plans for an international travel bubble should the government announce one. Cook Islands Tourism Industry Committee president Lianna Scott said the announcement was some small progress, but overall disappointing. "We've been waiting some time for an indication of a date, so yet another delay does still carry anxiety for businesses here in the island." Scott, who also manages the Muri Beach Club Hotel in Rarotonga, said many businesses were "very, very worried" they would have to close their doors when the wage subsidy ran out at the end of September. She acknowledged the need to open the border safely, but said New Zealand authorities were being "overly-cautious". "There just doesn't seem to be any real reasons why the borders should remain closed," Scott said. "We are Covid-free. We acted just as quickly as New Zealand acted for the very reason to have this ability to have a bubble."

People gathered at the announcement today. Photo: RNZ / Charlie Dreaver From next month, security guards contracted to the agency will be paid the living wage. Minister for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni says MSD was among the first government agencies to pay its employees the living wage in 2018 and it's now taking the initiative to pay its contracted security guards the same. "As Minister for Social Development, I am pleased that MSD has been able to do this for Tautiaki (guards). "There's more work to do to get other MSD contracted workers the living wage but it's a step in the right direction." E T team leader Yvette Taylor says today's announcement is a significant milestone in the campaign for the living wage. "This is the first government cleaning or security contract to be delivered at the living wage and it has finally happened, this is a huge victory," she says. Robert Duston, who has been a security guard for 13 years and works at MSD in Naenae, says it will mean a lot of guards in low income families won't have to suffer as he did. "For supporting my daughter growing up, it was important but very hard on low security pay, so I'm pleased for others in similar circumstances." Duston says the living wage will mean he will wake up every morning knowing he is being paid what he is worth. He says the pay rise means he can now save for a holiday for his 50th birthday next year. Another security guard, Jenith Alexandra Salcedo Guevara, says she is proud to be part of the change. "It will be a big difference to not only yourself but to everyone in the family, I will be able to help my mum and my grandma back in Colombia probably, it will be great because knowing the situation in Colombia, it's quite bad," she says. Salcedo Guevara says the extra money will mean she can put more towards her studies as well. Workplace Relations & Safety Minister Andrew Little says the government can ensure the living wage through procurement mechanisms. "This is an indication that we want to see all government departments making sure that not just the core staff but those who contract to government departments are getting at least the living wage," he says. Little says the work that frontline security guards do outside the MSD offices is skilled and they should be properly rewarded for the work that they do.

Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern during the campaign launch on 8 August, 2020. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers With just six weeks until election day, the party officially kicked off its campaign on Saturday. Prior to the previous general elections, Labour had then promised for a Fair Pay Agreement system in its election campaign. The policy would set the minimum standards for pay and certain conditions across whole industries. In 2018, a working group was set up to provide recommendations to the government and about a year later the government sought feedback on a range of options for the design. That consultation period ended in November, and since then, it has dropped off the radar. But Jacinda Ardern told Morning Report that she intends to bring in the Fair Pay Agreement system this time around if re-elected. "That would've been our hope this term," she said. Covid-19 had also brought to the forefront issues on setting standards for industries, she said. "The issue for instance of people working in certain workforces like security, where that has been a race to the bottom with terms and conditions, it means people are often working multiple jobs, it means it's a less safe working environment, our view is that actually having industry-wide agreements for some of these sectors where we see people on low pay actually would be a helpful thing to lift the standards." However, Ardern said she did not believe it would be implemented on a large number of sectors, but rather for those "most affected by a depletion of their terms and conditions". She also reiterated her comments from the campaign launch that it wasn't her intention for this to turn out to be a 'Covid election', but she said it was inevitable the debate would focus on that considering it was one of the biggest economic and health crisis the country has faced in a long time. "None of that changes the focus that we have had coming into both the 2017 election and this one, that we have some enormous challenges and our Covid response is a chance to tackle them." The Labour leader said more policy announcements could be expected during the campaign, but there were no large scale spending policies on the line because a significant amount had gone into the current Covid response. "Three billion dollars worth of infrastructure that we're going to roll out, that's on top of the large-scale New Zealand upgrade $12b worth of infrastructure we put in at the beginning of the year, we have $1.6b going into training and apprenticeships, and so already we're rolling out and what we're seeking is support to continue to rollout what has been significant investment. "People will have a very good sense of direction that we wish to take New Zealand in."

No need to ask his opinion on that as he vows to fight hard to keep his party in Parliament, embarking on an old school campaign across the country "in all the halls and small places in New Zealand". With Parliament adjourned and politicians ready to hit the campaign trail, RNZ presents a series of interviews with New Zealand's political leaders. No political journalist is prepared to publicly make the call Peters and his party will be toast come 19 September. He's proven the critics wrong on many an occasion and comes into his own when campaigning; but even he must be worried in this most unusual political landscape. Labour and Jacinda Ardern are dominant after a competent Covid response and weeks of blanket coverage to a captive audience. All other parties suffered, including New Zealand First -Labour's coalition partner. More from RNZ's Leader interviews: So how does Peters campaign against Ardern and her sky high personal popularity? "I'm not campaigning against her, quite the contrary," he insists. "Let me tell you that we made a decision in 2017 to go with a change style of leadership. We don't resile from that. "But we did promise all of our experience and understanding and common sense to the government. And we've done both those things. I'm not going to go and campaign against the last three years." Asked again about going up against Labour and Ardern, Peters lets us "into a secret"... "We're all campaigning against each other. That's what elections are about. So let's have a narrative common sense for goodness sake, we're all out there to get our market share on election night." He mounts the argument voters considering Labour should back New Zealand First instead to ensure "the kind of stability they've got now, as opposed to potential inexperience and experimentation, which will cost them a packet and cost their grandchildren all their lives to pay it off". Peters bridles at the suggestion he may not stay the course for the whole term if re-elected to Parliament: "Oh come on, what's my record? Have I ever done that?" "Why would someone put themselves on the line and travel the country, island to island, coast to coast from Invercargill to Kaitaia if they didn't want their party to win and to be part of it?" And does that include him as leader? "Well, I mean, this is getting rather tiresome, but I'm not going out there to lose. I'm not going out there to take some retirement. Look, one of these days I'll have a lovely retirement, but not yet." Since Peters lost Tauranga to National's Bob Clarkson in 2005, New Zealand First has not had an electorate seat as a backstop. Parties need to get either 5 percent of the party vote or a seat to secure a place in Parliament. Peters won the Northland seat in the 2015 by-election but it was returned to National at the 2017 general election. Enter Shane Jones, son of the north. Apparently not enough at the moment though to get the kind of support needed to take the seat, with a Colmar Brunton poll putting him a distant third behind the National and Labour candidates, a result understood to be consistent with National's internal polling. Yes, we know, bugger the polls, but Peters has some advice for his MP: "Just keep on working hard and keep on making the comparison of representation that brings benefits, does things for local people, as opposed to inexperience, no influence whatsoever, with no track record of ever performing for the electorate". "It's that blunt, it's that simple, it's over to Northlanders to see what's dramatically changed since Shane Jones and New Zealand First got a chance to do things in government versus the past." Translation: a reminder of the significant amount of money that's gone to the north via the $3 billion Provincial Growth Fund, overseen by Jones from his ministerial position within Cabinet. Labour and New Zealand First proclaim they've never done deals but both have been beneficiaries of strategic campaigning - Labour's Greg O'Connor in hariu in the 2017 general election and Peters himself in that 2015 by-election. No sign from Ardern though she's in any mind to do the same for Jones this election; it's now up to him to knock on doors and convince the voters of Northland he's the man for the job. The "critical thing", says Peters, is to "connect with people and reconnect as hard as you can given that now that the balloon's gone up and the race is happening". "With respect and not being arrogant" Peters points out he is the "most experienced contestant in this campaign", and says it will come down to the plan parties present and their past record. "Our idea is to go out there and say to people 'you've done so well' but things are never more precarious than they are now. Now, it's about the economy and you do need serious experienced politicians who have been here before and know what they're doing. "It's no chance, no time to experiment now." At the time of this interview, Peters was putting the finishing touches on the party's election manifesto but demurred when asked whether it would hark back to previous 'red meat' campaigns targeting immigration, law and order or race relations. "You're gonna see a lot of new ideas that we've never campaigned on before, but they will be based on the common sense foundation of a belief that is born of needing New Zealand to add value to the things we need to do more than ever ... to rely upon our own people who need to understand that we can't go offshore. "All the things we were talking about, dare I say it, before Covid-19." Peters is not known for holding back when criticising his opponents (indeed sometimes New Zealand First's own governing partners and with particular vitriol reserved for the Greens). This election though, he says he'll take the high road as "to go out and lambaste all the other political parties is not our idea". Prompting the somewhat sceptical question - so you're running a 'relentlessly positive' campaign as well? "You got it in one." New Zealand's First's time from 2005 to 2008 was dominated by controversy over political donations, and once again the party's under formal scrutiny for its fundraising practices. Back then when Labour under Helen Clark was fighting for the elusive fourth term and Peters for his political skin, he received a parliamentary censure after a high drama Privileges Committee inquiry over donations made to the Spencer Trust. The police and the Serious Fraud Office both investigated and the party was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, but it was only a matter of days before the 2008 election the police said publicly no offence was committed. Peters lost Tauranga and falling shy of the threshold after polling just over 4 percent, New Zealand First was out of Parliament. Fast forward to 2020 and the New Zealand First Foundation is under SFO investigation, again over political donations, with the agency indicating it will say whether or not it will lay charges before the 19 September election. Former National MP Jami-Lee Ross and three other men are facing charges in the High Court over donations made to the National Party, and Labour too is the subject of an SFO investigation - so how can voters have faith in politicians and the system as they go to the ballot box? He and the party were "completely exonerated" back in 2008 and "here we go again", says Peters. "People throwing dirt, mischief and malice with forethought in their minds, and we got to put up with it. But there's nothing new about that. "If you can't beat a political party legitimately, that's the tactic you resort to," he says. Peters reads nothing though into the timing of the outcome of the investigation, so close to an election. "Well, it doesn't say anything other than they think that they have got an investigation underway. And when they're finished the investigation, we'll know what that means." However no party is guilty until proven so in court, says Peters, and it "wouldn't be the first time that authorities have taken action and got it all wrong - at all". "We have said from day one we will co-operate, we welcome an inquiry of this nature, because now rather than foul rumour, we'll get the facts out there."

Labour's Helen White, left, and Chloe Swarbrick of the Green Party are standing in Auckland Central. Photo: Suppled / RNZ Labour says it won't make way for the Greens in the seat, which has been thrown wide open since National's Nikki Kaye announced her departure from politics. But the Greens' candidate - high-profile MP Chloe Swarbrick - doesn't want to be thrown a lifeline, even as her party hovers at about 5 percent in the polls. Last night, the candidates fronted up at the first electorate debate of the campaign at Freemans Bay School, where it was standing room only. Labour's candidate, Helen White, was just 1500 votes behind Nikki Kaye in Auckland Central in 2017. And Labour leader, Jacinda Ardern - who stood unsuccessfully against Kaye twice in the seat - said she wouldn't be doing any deals with the Greens to secure the seat for the left. "The last time, it was very close between the Labour candidate and the National candidate," she said. "The idea that you can tell voters to switch all of their votes in one direction, I just don't think is reasonable actually. Helen has a very good chance." Ardern was confident the Greens would get back into Parliament on the party vote, meaning they wouldn't need to win an electorate seat. And she was adamant - Labour hadn't done deals in the past, and she saw no reason to change that. This time, Green MP Chloe Swarbrick is running a two ticks campaign in Auckland Central - for both the party vote and the electorate vote. "Right now, we have a race that nobody could have anticipated, it's anybody's game and we are putting everything behind taking it," she said. And she was talking up her own - and her party's - chances. "We're confident we'll come back into Parliament on the party vote," she said. "We're also confident that we will be taking that seat, because we are putting everything into that grassroots campaign." During last night's debate, five candidates and one party representative fronted up to voters. With National only selecting its new candidate for the seat tonight, MP for East Coast Bays, Erica Stanford, was charged with filling in for the party. "What I can say is that I know that the final three have an incredible wealth of experience behind them and we've picked the candidates to go forward for the selection, because we know that they bring a wealth of experience and they will fit really well into this electorate," she said. The candidates faced questions on everything from the Covid-19 recovery, to tree protection and the future of Auckland's port. Responding to a question about whether it was fair to set the wage subsidy at a higher rate than the jobseeker benefit, Labour's Helen White said she didn't necessarily agree with that. "I think it happened because we've got a whole lot of people who are suddenly in a position where they've already got these kinds of outgoings and we didn't want to see mortgagee sales," she said. "But I don't think that that's the entire answer, I think the answer is we do need benefits to rise and we need to stop punishing people." Realistic about her chances in the seat, New Zealand First's candidate, list MP Jenny Marcroft, was campaigning for the party vote only. "There is no way that I expect you to vote for me, because you've never voted in the past for a New Zealand First candidate, and that's simply fact," she said. Chloe Swarbrick pointed to Auckland Central's voting record to show she has a realistic shot at winning the seat. "From 1993, when Sandra Lee took it for the Alliance, through to when Nikki Kaye took it, you appreciate hard work," she said. "I hope that I have shown you that I can be that hard worker for you, be that critic and conscience." Then Erica Stanford wrapped up reminding voters there's still a long way to go in the campaign. "You don't have to decide who you're going to vote for tonight, regardless of what you've been told earlier this evening, you don't have to go home tonight and write it down on a piece of paper and remember it for election day. You've got a really long time to make up your mind," she said. Three people have been short-listed for the National Party's Auckland Central selection meeting tonight.

Green Party co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson It released its 'Home's for All' policy yesterday which has an ambitious target to get all 18,000 people on the social housing waiting list into homes within five years. It wants to create a non-profit rental sector, and to do that it wants to let the public housing agency Kinga Ora increase total borrowing from about $7 billion to $12bn. It will also offer Crown guarantees for community housing providers, including iwi, to build new properties which can be rented out long-term. Party co-leader Marama Davidson said it wants to build 5000 new affordable homes a year, and the only way to reach that target would be with the help of the community housing providers. "It is the community housing sector who know their communities, who have got the relationships with the financial sector as well as with local neighbourhoods iwi and hap. "Who have got the experience of how-to-build what for the different community needs - that is how we are going to be able to increase that capacity." Far North Mori social housing provider He Korowai Trust's chief executive, Ricky Houghton, said the plan was a "game changer". "It offers nothing but hope for the impoverished living conditions of families up here in Northland ... people are still living in cowsheds, buses and lean-tos." Houghton said some families renting in the Far North were living in third world conditions and for them help cannot come soon enough. He said his organisation would jump at the chance to ramp up its building programme to meet the huge demand in the region. "If this policy came to Northland tomorrow morning I've got at least 25 families that I could put into their own homes using this policy." But National Party housing spokesperson Jacqui Dean slammed it as another pie-in-the-sky idea from a coalition partner in the government that's broken all its promises on house building. "They should have delivered 16,000 KiwiBuild houses by now but they've only managed just around 400. "So to promise 5000 extra houses a year is nothing more than just wishful thinking and is destined to go the same way as KiwiBuild." The Green Party also wants professional property managers to held to the same standards as real estate agents, requiring them to become licensed and have clear professional obligations. Property Managers' Institute president David Pearse said the policy would be useless unless it required everyone who rented property to be licensed. "It just shows the level of ignorance from the Green Party because at the end of the day only 40 percent of the properties are currently managed by property managers. "So you can regulate property managers all you like but it doesn't have a significant impact on the huge 60 percent of the properties out there that are undertaken by self-managing owners who are doing it themselves." He said it was private landlords who do not follow the rules and treated renters badly - whereas professional property managers generally did excellent work. "Overall they are doing a fantastic job but they just become a punching bag for the Greens and Labour." The whole Green Party package will cost about $1.2bn, $950m for capital and $250m for operational spending.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423110/green-party-plans-to-clear-record-high-social-housing-list-in-five-years|2020-08-09|The Green Party has unveiled its housing plan which aims to get the record-high number of people off the social housing waiting list, while improving the size and quality of the rental market. Green Party co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson at today's announcement Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson It includes using the Crown backed scheme already used for KiwiBuild to build more rental houses, expanding the Progressive Home Ownership scheme announced last month, and regulating property managers. The goal is to clear the social housing list - currently about 18,000 - within five years. The party wants to create a non-profit rental sector by offering Crown guarantees for Community Housing Providers, including iwi, to build new properties which can be rented out long-term. That would include $250 million in seed funding for "newly built community non-profit rental homes". It is still pushing for a full warrant of fitness for rental and wants the financial assistance for renters reviewed. The Greens also want to make sure there's no net loss of land that could be used for housing, except when it is being returned to mana whenua for housing development. "As well as making sure houses aren't sold off unnecessarily, the Green Party will protect the Crown's total landholdings, so future governments retain housing options ... the Green Party will ensure the Government Policy Statement (GPS) on housing and urban development provides clear direction on divestment of Crown land and reinvestment in new builds." The waiting list for social housing is at a record high, and in response, the Greens want government agencies to gear up and for Kinga Ora's borrowing limit to be increased from $7.1 billion to $12b over the next five years "to allow it to scale up the Crown build programme to 5000 new homes a year". "This funding will be available to support Kinga Ora to build homes directly, and to contract building to community housing providers." Some progress has been made on improving housing standards but the Greens still want a full warrant of fitness for rentals; "requiring all rental properties to be independently assessed for compliance with the Healthy Homes Standards". "This will be introduced in phases, matching the implementation of the standards themselves - applying first to new rental agreements, and then expanding to all rental properties." The plan would also require property managers to come under the same regulatory regime as real estate agents. "This will introduce a licensing requirement for property managers and provide clear professional obligations and complaints mechanisms for misconduct, whether or not it reaches the threshold of breaching the Residential Tenancies Act," the policy says. Party co-leader Marama Davidson describes the plan as "a bold and cohesive blueprint to ensure we're all in a warm, dry home, no matter where we live or whether we rent or own." "Successive governments have sold off too much social and community housing while letting the homes we do have fall into disrepair," she says. "They've also allowed speculators to over-invest in property, pushing up house prices and leaving too many families struggling with the high cost of rent." She says the housing plan will create a "sustainable, non-profit rental sector" by using government money as a guarantee to build new properties, to be managed as long-term rentals. The policy also includes a specific plan to support papakinga and improve housing for Mori. The Greens say there are "numerous barriers to developing whenua Mori for papakinga", created by successive governments, including "government support across multiple agencies that is uncoordinated and underfunded, problems accessing finance, planning restrictions, and lack of infrastructure". A specialist cross-agency Mori Housing Development Unit would be created, and the Kinga Whenua Loan Scheme would be "reviewed and reformed". Davidson acknowledged the Greens have been part of the government under which numbers on the waiting list soared, but says there should have been a much greater focus on public housing. "I've been quite clear about that, I've said that this term ... that leaving things to market and commercial developments has shown to not work both in this government and many previous governments. "So I do I am quite upfront about that. And that's why this plan prioritises public and affordable housing, a not for profit rental sector." But she also says "four decades of neglect" have contributed to so many people waiting to get into a decent house. The "key part" to tackling those record-high numbers was the involvement of the non-government organisations, Davidson says. "While the government has been limited in its capacity it's the involvement of the community housing sector who know their communities, who have got the relationships with the financial sector, as well as with local neighbourhoods, iwi and hap." Davidson says the total package would cost about $1.2b - $950m for capital and $250m for operational spending. However, the plan has been dismissed as "wishful thinking" by the National Party. Spokesperson Jacqui Dean says "blue-sky thinking has never been the Green's problem, but delivery has". "The government partners talked a big game on housing before the last election and they haven't delivered. KiwiBuild was a disaster and it took three years just to get started on progressive homeownership." Dean says the Greens' plan would mean more regulation and red tape, placing "onerous" requirements and costs on landlords, "scaring them out of the market, reducing the country's rental stock and putting the price up on those that remain".

From left, Shane Jones, Willow-Jean Prime and Matt Hunt. Photo: RNZ / Labour Party / RNZ The Colmar Brunton Poll for TVNZ's Q+A programme gives the incumbent National MP Matt King a firm lead, with 46 percent support. Labour's Willow-Jean Prime has 31 percent support and Jones just 15 percent. Eleven percent of respondents said they did not know who they would vote for, or declined to answer. pic.twitter.com/snAgUD0Hq8 NZ First leader Winston Peters won the seat in a 2015 by-election, but was ousted by King in the 2017 general election. The seat is seen as a must-win for New Zealand First, which a One News poll last month placed at 2 percent in the standings. Jones told Q+A he needed to get the "political jackhammer" out, with his message to Northlanders that if they wanted to get NZ First back into Parliament they should vote for him or the party. King said he was "heartened" by the poll result but was "taking nothing for granted". Prime told the programme she was "really pleased to see that there is a huge level of support there, not only for myself but also for the Labour Party". Labour Leader Jacinda Ardern was out campaigning at the Grey Lynn farmers market in her Mt Albert electorate this morning and told reporters she saw no reason to reconsider her stance on a Northland seat deal. "We've said that we wouldn't, and actually New Zealand First hasn't asked. "We've both as parties been very clear, we're campaigning as separate parties as we did last election", she said. Ardern said she has never written New Zealand First off in any election, and this time was no different. She reiterated that her stance was the same for the Auckland Central seat, where Greens candidate Chloe Swarbrick is up against Labour's Helen White. If the Greens won the seat it would secure them a spot back in Parliament, without having to rely on getting over the five percent party vote threshold. "Ultimately I don't think what we're debating here is a chance of them being out of Parliament, I don't agree with that suggestion, and during campaigns that's where we see there's more time and attention across the spectrum and we do tend to see those minor parties lift," she said. In terms of party support in Northland, Labour is at 41 percent, National 38 percent, ACT 8 percent, NZ First 7 percent and the Greens attract 4.7 percent, the poll has found. Prime said it was the first time in recent history Labour was ahead of National in a poll. A total of 503 eligible voters were polled and the margin of error is 4.3 percent.

National Party leader Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ With Parliament dissolved and politicians ready to hit the campaign trail, RNZ presents a series of interviews with New Zealand's political leaders. Collins is still shy of a month into the job but in her media blitz she and her arched eyebrows are everywhere, along with the party slogan "Strong team, More Jobs, Better Economy". Is the tagline "strong team" verging on the comedic though, when you look back at the past few horror months for National: a rolling maul of resignations, sackings and leadership changes? "Look at our front bench. Look at it," Collins says in defence. Then follows a roll call of frontbenchers, their attributes and experience, including of deputy leader and long serving MP Gerry Brownlee. "I mean, we've got myself and Gerry with the years of experience, but not just years of experience, the breadth of experience. Look at my background, not only as a lawyer, but a small business owner, and a public company director, and someone who's been in charge of quasi-judicial authorities. "I mean that is an enormous wealth of experience that I bring, plus being ministers... Gerry with the Christchurch rebuild... and what he gave back to the people of New Zealand." * Jacinda Ardern's leader interview National not only lost some trust and credibility after the conduct of now former (or soon to be former) MPs, but the departure of Paula Bennett, Nikki Kaye and Amy Adams puts a big hole in that frontbench, not just as women MPs but as three seasoned former Cabinet ministers. The MPs ensconced in the safest blue seats tend to be predominantly male, and many with strong conservative Christian views. Adams and Kaye represented the more socially liberal wing of National and with sitting MPs Chris Bishop and Nicola Willis in potentially in precarious positions, the face of the party looks quite different to what it was under John Key and even Bill English. The lean towards that religious or social conservatism may not sit so comfortably with right leaning voters looking more to National for economic leadership. Beating Labour and Jacinda Ardern is a "big ask", Collins says, but she's playing to win. She gives recent examples of the polls being proved wrong, providing some hope and confidence. "The polls all said Brexit was going to fail, people said that Boris Johnson wouldn't get to be leader of the Conservatives and win an election and he did. People also said polls were obviously against Scott Morrison, closer to home, and said Bill Shorten was just going to romp him and look what happened here." She believes voters will back National, pointing to the public response when she's out and about. "I've never seen crowds like this, someone said to me the other day when I was in Palmerston North and there were 420 people in a packed out convention centre, standing room only that the last time he'd seen anything like this was in the days of Muldoon. So that was the year 1975 when he took out a first term Labour government." "I'm always a very confident person, particularly when I know I'm right," Collins says. Many of those at the Palmerston North convention centre would have been National supporters any may not need much convincing, but Collins says leaders would ignore those loyalists at their peril. "Very easily parties can become very disconnected from reality by chasing everyone else's vote but that base is not just our base, plenty of other people have been turning up at those meetings who are not hard core National party people and they're turning up and they want to hear what we've got to say. "So always shore up the base, but from there move out and I think that just standing for something makes a big difference for people. "If I stand for what I believe in, if the National Party stands for what it believes in, that it will in fact bring people to us. "That has been shown time and time again, how to win is not just trying to race off and appease particular groups and try to be something else. There's no point me trying to be the leader of the Labour party, although I think I'd be excellent at the role should I wish to. "Jacinda Ardern has said she accepts there is an election, well, welcome to democracy, I'd say. You have to have an election and by the way, it's going to be a contest of ideas for the National Party." Collins has no qualms taking Ardern on directly and criticising her personal performance. She asserts she's a decisive leader - "unlike Ardern", and Collins includes in her assessment the much lauded role the prime minister played in the Covid-19 response. "She's relied very heavily on a very competent Director-General of Health... and she's rightly taken his advice," Collins says. "Very easy to close down borders, very hard to actually reset and restart an economy and that is where we are seeing no policy whatsoever from the government." Labour leader Jacinda Ardern. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone According to her, Ardern failed to act decisively when the then minister of health was busted driving his family 20 kilometres to take a walk during the alert level 4 lockdown; "it took her about three months to sack David Clark - he would have been gone in a nanosecond". Collins is happy to put her leadership team up against Labour's to deliver "certainty" to voters. "You can have Jacinda Ardern and Kelvin Davis or you can have myself and Gerry Brownlee. Who actually has the track record in getting stuff done? I can tell you what, it's Gerry and me, we know how to get stuff done and we know how to move through things." Collins urges voters to look back at the promises made by Labour in 2017, Ardern "basically promising to end homelessness by the winter of 2018". "What she forgot to tell people is that that meant she'd stick a lot of people in motels, the same thing she said we shouldn't be doing." She also cites the thousands of people waiting for a state house; a "shocking indictment and she can't blame us". Not only have the National Party leadership changes taken their toll on the caucus, but also on policy development. As leader, at the start of last year Simon Bridges announced the party's initial plan for tax: Threshold adjustments resulting in people paying less income tax, ruling out new taxes and repealing the Auckland fuel tax. A year later he flagged a package of tax cuts aimed at those on the average wage. Then Covid-19 happened, followed fast by the leaderships ructions. MPs had worked on a series of detailed policy documents that disappeared off the party website when Todd Muller took over the leadership; by all accounts they're back on the table but not back on online as National races against the clock to pull together a credible, well-costed election manifesto. Covid-19 and the ongoing damage to the economy will inevitably dominate the election; while policy from both big parties has been light on the ground so far, what has been released predominantly relates to jobs, economic stimulus and how to support the tens of thousands heading for the benefit queue. Collins won't leave any room for accusations of slashing benefits or not showing compassion to a electorate looking to politicians for leadership at such a crucial time. "You can't have welfare cuts", she says, when so many people are out of work. "It's very important that people are in jobs wherever possible and I have a huge commitment to people being in work. I have been in work pretty much all my adult life and my view has always been that work is not only good for the economy, it's good for people, but it's very good for people's mental health and their sense of well-being. "I think we're going to have a crisis in this if we continue to not actually make sure that there are jobs coming through." Unlike previous elections, National will not campaign on tax cuts, nor would a National government introduce any new taxes, Collins says. The question then is - how would National get debt back to 30 percent of GDP in a decade - is that a pipe dream? "It's an aspiration", she says, as articulated by finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith. "He has said that he would like us to get down to 30 percent of GDP in a decade or so, it may be more than that in a decade or so because of the fact that we're still waiting for the pre-election fiscal update... and we need to make sure that we actually can do exactly that. "But we're also saying that's not the big hard and fast rule, that's something we would like to aspire to, but it is more important for us that we take this opportunity to build the infrastructure, that we actually do things that create not only jobs for people, but are meaningful and that will add to assets for the country."

Labour leader Jacinda Ardern talks to media after Party's re-election campaign launch. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers Leader Jacinda Ardern announced the assistance package at the party's campaign launch in Auckland this afternoon. The government's existing Flexi-wage scheme - a wage subsidy to help employers hire those on a benefit at risk of long-term unemployment - would be revamped and expanded under a re-elected Labour Party, with the average amount a business can access to hire a worker more than doubling. The party believes scaling up the scheme could enable 40,000 people to be employed. Jacinda Ardern, speaking at the launch today, said $30 million will also be ring-fenced to help unemployed people start a business through an expanded Flexi-wage self employment programme, which will provide the equivalent of the minimum wage for up to 30 hours a week. The Labour Party campaign launch in Auckland. Photo: Supplied The main elements of the scheme: The scheme would be paid for out of the underspend from the targeted wage subsidy extension. Businesses would have to prove that the job is sustainable in the long term, and would only receive the payment once the person had been employed for six weeks. "The new Flexi-wage scheme is a key plank of our economic plan to support businesses to recover and to provide jobs to those who have lost work due to Covid," Ardern said. "It will directly help businesses who are getting back on their feet after lockdown to take on new staff while also supporting those New Zealanders who have lost their jobs to get back into work and off a benefit quicker." Leader Jacinda Ardern says a new Flexi-wage scheme is a key plank of Labour's economic plan to support businesses. Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers She said many businesses were willing to retain staff and take on new employees but needed some extra support. "They can't do it alone," Ardern said. "With over 20,000 New Zealanders now receiving the Covid-19 Income Relief Payment and more on the unemployment benefit it is critical we are doing all we can to help get these often skilled workers back into jobs as quickly as possible." She said Labour wanted to "encourage entrepreneurship and innovation" without forcing people to use their retirement savings to set up a new business. "Those without formal training qualifications, those over 50, disabled people, and Mori and Pasifika workers will disproportionately bear the brunt of an economic downturn. The scheme is designed to support those hardest hit to find work again. "This is a scheme that works. Evaluations show it generates $7 in benefits for every dollar invested and that 70 percent of people hired during the evaluation period had a job at the end of it." Ardern did not have any figures on how many net new jobs the scheme would create. "Ultimately what we are looking for are jobs that will last in the long term but it may be the case that this is what it takes to make the difference between an employer making the decision to take someone on or not and equally support them to take on someone who otherwise might face longer term unemployment", she said. National has also promised to introduce a hiring subsidy of $10,000 per worker for any business that takes on a full-time worker, in a scheme that it said would cost $500 million, while another National policy would help people who have recently lost their job to start a business, by allowing them to access up to $20,000 of their KiwiSaver. "It's important to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation as part of the Covid recovery without forcing people to use their retirement savings to get back on their feet," said Ardern. She said the wage subsidy scheme - due to finish on 1 September - had prevented a spike in unemployment. "We need to keep moving with our plan. The Flexi-wage is just the latest addition to the raft of jobs initiatives and business support we have already put in place to drive our economic recovery," Ardern said. National leader Judith Collins said the Flexi-wage scheme was the policy introduced by the previous National government in 2012. Labour's announcement was an acknowledgement the scheme was the right thing to introduce eight years ago, Collins said. "The issue is, that policy is very focused on those people most likely to find it hard to get jobs and that was actually all about getting people who we'd call more vulnerable into work. "The issue is now actually, things have changed. We're looking at people from one end of the spectrum to the other, highly-skilled and highly-experienced people who are themselves losing jobs, and that's why I think it's not one size fits all, we've gotta be very agile in making sure that we get as many of those people who are finding themselves out of work into work." When asked if National would support the policy, Collins said: "if we're in government we'll obviously have our own policy, but the policy is a National party policy we put in place so it's hard for us not to support something that's our own policy". During her speech, Ardern summarised the Labour Party's key achievements in office and then said: "We haven't always achieved everything we set out to, and there have been lessons for us in that. "We wanted more homes for first home buyers. We wanted light rail in Auckland. But we've had to accept that sometimes when you try things that have never been done before, you won't always succeed, but that doesn't mean you should give up." She said Labour had undertaken the largest house building programme of any government since the 1970s, with 18,000 state houses to be delivered by 2024. Kiwibuild has proved far less successful than the government hoped, however, Labour says it's on track to deliver 18,000 state houses by 2024. Photo: RNZ / Robin Martin Ardern also discussed the impact of Covid-19 on the country and whether it was set to dominate the election campaign. "I would rather not have had to close our borders. Or put in place the most severe restrictions on personal freedoms in our country's history. "But it has been our new reality, and one that the team of 5 million have made work in the most extraordinary way." She said New Zealand now has one of the most open economies in the world, and has a head start on its recovery and rebuild, but Labour believed it had unfinished business. "And so yes, there is no denying that Covid has changed New Zealand, and therefore it will inevitably change what we talk about this election." Ardern told reporters following her speech that it wasn't a case that she wanted people to think of this as the "Covid election", more an acceptance that "that is how this will turn out to be". She said she did not accept that the Covid-19 crisis and Labour's boost in the polls were intrinsically linked. "Our view is the health response is going to drive just how much New Zealand's economy is affected, and we've always believed it. "We have to campaign on our recovery and our rebuild. It's not enough to keep looking backwards, we have to demonstrate where we will take New Zealand and how we will support New Zealanders."

National Party leader Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Ana Tovey It's headed by party leader Judith Collins, deputy leader Gerry Brownlee and finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith. The remaining top 10 matches the party's caucus rankings, announced by Collins last month. Chris Bishop and Nicola Willis, who were both ranked in the 40s at the last election, have skyrocketed to number seven and 13, reflecting the caucus line-up. Alfred Ngaro has fallen to number 30 on the list - the only MP to be removed from the party's top 20 when compared with Collins' caucus rankings. Ngaro is contesting the Te Atatu seat which is currently held by Labour MP Phil Twyford. Collins is confident he will win the seat, "anybody can beat Phil Twyford". When asked if Ngaro was moved down the list because he last year considered starting his own party, Collins said it wasn't something that was considered. "We don't discuss what's happened in the list ranking committee. I think that we all understand that the National Party is a party of those who choose to be with us and everyone is very impressed by the hard work of our team," Collins said. National Party president Peter Goodfellow said he was at the launch of Ngaro's campaign to win the Te Atatu seat. "He had more hoardings out there...than his opponent and effectively there's no reason why he can't run such a strong campaign that he wins that seat," Goodfellow said. The highest ranked person who is not a sitting MP is Nancy Lu at number 26 - she has been placed higher than more than a dozen incumbents. Lu has a great background and is very strong in the "Nats sense", Goodfellow said. "She's been in the private sector for five or six years, working with private companies. She has great connections with the Chinese community," he said. The lowest ranked sitting MP is Jo Hayes at 44. This was to ensure the party has a good mix of skills and experience next term, Collins said. "It was a decision made by the committee...we are also very confident we can get Jo back in as well. But it's very important to that we recognise that we've got new talent coming in as well," she said. Maureen Pugh, who labelled "fing useless" by former party leader Simon Bridges, has been boosted up to 19 in the party list. Pugh had been a "truly outstanding" local member of Parliament based on the West Coast, Collins said. "She has shown incredible loyalty to the party, but also she has the deepest connections within that electorate. It is an electorate that the National Party should win, it is one where we represent the values of the people of the West Coast-Tasman area, far more than their current sitting electorate MP. "We want to send a big signal to the West Coast that we value their choice in terms of Maureen and that we expect her to work very, very hard to make sure she gets that seat. But also, we want to say to her that her work has been valued," Collins said. When asked if Pugh's party ranking was an apology for the comments made by Bridges, Collins said it was a very unfortunate situation. "I'm sure you were as impressed as I was, and the whole team, the list ranking team, at Maureen's extreme graciousness and dignity in dealing with the leak of that very nasty recording," she said. Former Air New Zealand boss Christopher Luxon, who is standing for the Botany electorate currently held by former National MP Jami-Lee Ross, is one of the lowest on the list of 75 at number 61. "It's one of the safest seats in the country," Collins said. "All our new candidates who are placed in very strong National seats have been...grouped together and that's because it didn't seem to hurt for John Key and it didn't seem to hurt for me, when we first came in as candidates," she added. National has faced recent criticised for its lack of diversity in the Party. When asked how diversity factored into the decision making process, Collins said candidates were ranked based on "the merits, the talent, the hard work." "It is important to represent New Zealand and we have gone some way to make sure that we do. We don't represent one particular group within New Zealand, we are the National Party for everyone," Collins said. Party president Peter Goodfellow said National was "incredibly fortunate to be able to draw on such a diverse and experienced team of passionate Kiwis." 1 Judith Collins - Papakura 2 Gerry Brownlee - Ilam 3 Paul Goldsmith - Epsom 4 Simon Bridges - Tauranga 5 Dr Shane Reti - Whangarei 6 Todd McClay - Rotorua 7 Chris Bishop - Hutt South 8 Todd Muller - Bay of Plenty 9 Louise Upston - Taupo 10 Scott Simpson - Coromandel 11 David Bennett - Hamilton East 12 Michael Woodhouse - Dunedin 13 Nicola Willis - Wellington Central 14 Jacqui Dean - Waitaki 15 Mark Mitchell - Whangaparaoa 16 Melissa Lee - Mt Albert 17 Andrew Bayly - Port Waikato 18 Dr Nick Smith - Nelson 19 Maureen Pugh - West Coast-Tasman 20 Barbara Kuriger - Taranaki-King Country 21 Harete Hipango - Whanganui 22 Jonathan Young - New Plymouth 23 Tim Macindoe - Hamilton West 24 Kanwaljit Singh Bakshi - Panmure-Otahuhu 25 Paulo Garcia - List 26 Nancy Lu - List 27 Parmjeet Parmar - Mt Roskill 28 Agnes Loheni - Mangere 29 Dale Stephens - Christchurch Central 30 Alfred Ngaro - Te Atatu 31 Matt Doocey - Waimakariri 32 Stuart Smith - Kaikoura 33 Lawrence Yule - Tukituki 34 Denise Lee - Maungakiekie 35 Simon O'Connor - Tamaki 36 Brett Hudson - Ohariu 37 Simeon Brown - Pakuranga 38 Ian McKelvie - Rangitikei 39 Erica Stanford - East Coast Bays 40 Matt King - Northland 41 Chris Penk - Kaipara ki Mahurangi 42 Tim van de Molen - Waikato 43 Dan Bidois - Northcote 44 Jo Hayes - Mana 45 Katie Nimon - Napier 46 Catherine Chu - Banks Peninsula 47 Hamish Campbell - Wigram 48 David Patterson - Rongotai 49 Lisa Whyte - New Lynn 50 Rima Nakhle - Takanini 51 Liam Kernaghan - Taieri 52 Bala Beeram - Kelston 53 Lincoln Platt - Christchurch East 54 William Wood - Palmerston North 55 Nuwi Samarakone - Manurewa 56 Mark Crofskey - Remutaka 57 Jake Bezzant - Upper Harbour 58 Mike Butterick - Wairarapa 59 Tim Costley - Otaki 60 Nicola Grigg - Selwyn 61 Christopher Luxon - Botany 62 Joseph Mooney - Southland 63 Penny Simmonds - Invercargill 64 Tania Tapsell - East Coast 65 Simon Watts - North Shore 66 TBC - Auckland Central 67 TBC - Rangitata 68 Adrienne Pierce - List 69 Senthuran Arulanantham - List 70 Sang Cho - List 71 Rachel Afeaki-Taumoepeau - List 72 Trish Collett - List 73 Ava Neal - List 74 Katrina Bungard - List 75 Shelley Pilkington - List

nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/423001/leader-interviews-jacinda-ardern-says-vision-not-defined-by-covid-19|2020-08-10|Labour's campaign slogan "Let's Keep Moving" is hardly the most inspirational but reflects the conservative game plan - trade on the Covid response and stay on track. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Labour leader Jacinda Ardern describes the past three years - which have been dominated by disaster - as "unexpected, many high points but many moments no-one could have anticipated". March 15th, Whaakari/White Island and the global pandemic will "feature heavily as defining experiences" in the history books, she says. But she's also "mindful of the obligation that we have to the people who put us here" to make sure "alongside of responding to those issues that we still keep and stay on track with the agenda we came to Parliament with". "So, yes. Covid will predetermine a lot of what we debate this election, but voters still have a choice to make as to whether or not they continue with the plan that we have pitched or whether or not they choose to stop and move on to an alternate programme," says Ardern. She's mounting the argument as the governing party, expectations of fresh, new policy during an election campaign should be lower. "The direction of an incumbent should never be defined by a mere six week programme because our job and our duty is to make changes when we have the opportunity, not to save them up merely for a political moment". Partly driving that is Labour has a lot of unfinished business because of what was not achieved by the coalition, including welfare reform, significantly reducing inequality and child poverty and big transport projects like Auckland light rail. Covid also forced major spending programmes that were announced some months ago; they've sucked up vast amounts of money, but that doesn't preclude the presentation of new ideas. Ardern says Labour's "vision has not been defined by a pandemic", but she hopes it will be "accelerated" by one. "Building back better" has become the mantra. She points out the coalition was able to pass close to 200 pieces of legislation with consensus; although only one indicator, she says that's "a good sign of good faith between the parties and the role I play as the 'glue' in these relationships and that has been a large part of my job too". The often volatile relationship between the three governing parties has also been a feature of this term, in what Ardern describes as one of New Zealand's "purest" MMP governments. Much was thrashed out in private and consensus reached, but there was plenty of disagreement and clashing of big personalities played out in full view - MMP in action. The closer the election, the more aggressive coalition partner New Zealand First has become in distancing itself from Labour and the Greens - sometimes through outright criticism. That's done nothing to harm the "good" relationships, even while dealing with tricky issues, and that was "the same today as it was six months ago", Ardern says. She "shrugs off" the combative stance taken by New Zealand First and says she'll continue to defend the government's record. "You won't hear me speaking unkindly or in a disparaging way of anyone I've worked with because I think that does a disservice to what we've managed to do together." Would she rather work with the Greens or New Zealand First if Labour's in a position to form a government?: "I'll work with the position, should we be in it," she says. "My job though is not to sit and make calculations around what might come in the future, it's to focus on the Labour - and that, in a way, is not something I get as much room to do during a term in office". The promise of putting more money in voters' pockets through tax changes has tended to be one past point of difference between Labour and National, but not so this time. Neither will be campaigning on a programme of tax cuts in 2020. Not only will the next government need to find ways to boost revenue, not slash it, but even Covid wouldn't be a big enough excuse for Labour given its opposition to broad based tax cuts costing a lot and disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. One difference though is National would look to repay the mammoth Covid debt faster than Labour, prompting accusations from Ardern the party is lining up for austerity cuts to the tune of $80 billion. Not true, counters National, but as with Steven Joyce's 'fiscal hole' last election, how the numbers stack up will come under increasing scrutiny as the campaign rolls out and once the parties have laid out their full policy line-up. National leader Judith Collins has ruled out any tax increases under a National government. Not so Ardern, when asked if those on high incomes could pay under Labour. To give an indication of "where the thinking is at the moment", Ardern pointed to significant tax breaks for small business owners as part of the Covid response, "trying to use the tax system to support cash flow at a really cash-restrained time", but would not specifically rule out a increase for the wealthiest New Zealanders. "My answer is I haven't released our tax policy ... I've not got into the 'rule in, rule out' game because it can go on for quite some time, I've found, best instead if I just respond to our tax policy once I've put it out." In line with her previous commitment however, Ardern did rule out any future capital gains tax. Ardern herself took on portfolio responsibility for tackling child poverty; Labour put in place targets for how it would be measured, to be reported back through the Budget process. Budget 2020 concluded - due to the time lag on quality data and Covid-19 - that Treasury forecasts about the impact of policies like the Families Package "no longer apply, however they do indicate that the government was broadly on track to meet the three-year targets on the two primary measures of low income". The third measure is 'material hardship'. Seven of the nine child poverty indicators have gone from 'declining' to 'improving', says Ardern, pushing back on the suggestion the coalition has failed to shift the dial. "The reason I say we haven't failed is because all of the forecasting we've done has looked at from the proportion that we have, that generally indicates statistically that it looks like we are having the impact we anticipated having." Covid-19 will of course present even more challenges, but the full impact is not yet clear, she says. Ardern lists initiatives like indexation of benefit to wage growth, the BestStart and winter energy payments, paid parental leave extension and lunches in schools as all making a difference. "They have been layered so sometimes the impact of those different policies hasn't always been acknowledged but when you look at for instance, a sole parent, in some parts of the country can be receiving up to 60 percent more than they were when we came into office. "I stand by what we've done in child poverty, the numbers tell a story but they also say we're not done - and we're not". The "lag" in the data is frustrating, says Ardern. "We right now only have data that tells us about, only partially, the changes that we've made". Some of the first data covered the last years under National for which the coalition copped some criticism, which she "always found quite galling". "So we don't still yet have a complete picture of the impact we've had and we won't for some time but the starting point is still that we are broadly on track to achieve our goals". In their confidence and supply agreement, Labour and the Greens committed to "overhaul the welfare system, ensure access to entitlements, remove excessive sanctions and review Working For Families so that everyone has a standard of living and income that enables them to live in dignity and participate in their communities, and lifts children and their families out of poverty". "There is more work to be done ... nor have we finished," Ardern says. There has been a "culture change" at the Ministry of Social Development, she says, and "if you talk to beneficiary advocates they'll tell you that there has been a significant change in the way that people are treated ... which was fundamental to us". The structural problems Labour and the Greens believe are inherent in the system have not been addressed. Covid again played a part and boosting benefit payments and other entitlements were a key aspect of the government response. "There have been significant changes that have affected accommodation supplement, indexation, general benefit increases, work on some of the sanctions and the cultural reform programme, we've also said we do still have a rolling programme with the Welfare Expert Advisory Group that has helped us set an agenda going forward too", Ardern says. Work and Income has been scaled up with "hundreds" of extra case workers, she says. "What was clear to us is it wasn't a really active Labour market response that we had in our system and we recognised that before Covid. People coming into the system weren't getting the support that they needed - be it that they weren't getting their entitlements but even support back into appropriate work." She says the lesson from the global financial crisis is the need to "work for the longer term; every time there's an earthquake, an economic shock, we revert to these reactions rather than building something into our system". Ardern sees any regret as a "wasted emotion" when reflecting on her term as Prime Minister, but there is more she'd like to do on inequality. "Yeah, just keep going...I will not feel satisfied until I feel, and probably the job will never feel done for me, until I feel we're living up to our reputation that we are a country that cares for its most vulnerable."

The National Party wants to see more women taking up trades. [file pic] Photo: 123RF Many of the projects on the list will create work in construction - a male-dominated industry. That's after new unemployment numbers revealed that 10,000 of the 11,000 people who lost their jobs during the pandemic were women. The underutilisation rate - indicating when employees are working fewer hours than they'd like to - is also higher for women. Earlier this week Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner Saunoamaali'i Dr Karanina Sumeo told Morning Report the numbers reflect the fact that women tend to be more represented in retail and hospitality, but also part-time work. Barbara Kuriger who is the National Party's spokesperson for women told Morning Report there were a range of opportunities available for women, but they needed more encouragement. She said the previous National-led government had done a lot of work offering women chances to work in science, technology and engineering. "We've just got to open our minds a bit more around women - building their courage and confidence and enabling them to get involved in these projects because currently there's only about 11 percent of women who make up these projects." This number needed to increase, she said. Barbara Kuriger Photo: RNZ / Daniela Maoate - Cox She had recently visited Waikeria Prison in her electorate. "It was fantastic to see women driving these big machines rebuilding the prison so we've just got to get a lot more women involved in the trades." Kuriger also supported the current Minister of Agriculture's project, Opportunity Grows Here, which was a campaign to encourage people who have lost their jobs to move into rural areas to find work. Fonterra has opportunities for about 1400 women for both farm and non-farm jobs, she said. For those who needed to find a job quickly, there are opportunities to gain an insight into what a job entails at training bodies such as the Telford Southern Institute of Technology in Balclutha. "There are opportunities for people to go and get the basic skills they need to do a lot of these jobs in rural New Zealand." ITO training would help people build further on their careers over time, she said.

Police at the Grand Mecure Hotel in Wellington, which is being used as a managed isolation facility. Photo: RNZ /Dom Thomas Talks of private pay-as-you-go isolation hotels emerged from the Covid-19 recovery summit in Auckland yesterday. Those behind the idea said borders could re-open to international students, highly skilled foreign workers and wealthy tourists, but despite enthusiasm by sector leaders yesterday, the reality has come crashing down today. The public were not so sure. "I think by and large it is working - I don't know why we would privatise - it would probably end up costing even more," a Wellington woman said. A Northland man said he thought the current system was working. "Don't try and fix it if it is not broken." Matt, on Lambton Quay in Wellington, said he felt like the responsibility should fall to the government. "I know that they've still had their mistakes but I feel like that they should be accountable for what's coming in and out of the country... I would trust the government more than the private sector." Infectious diseases specialist Siouxsie Wiles wasn't so sure either. "We don't want to be like Victoria," she said. Military-controlled facilities were the way to go, she added. "They've shown us what it takes - it's about process, it's about adhering to those rules and I am concerned that we don't have any good evidence that the private sector alone could do that," she said. The PSA union said it was deeply concerned about the plan. National secretary Glenn Barclay said it would put New Zealand at risk of another outbreak. "The experiment in private prison management was a failure - the rail privatisation was a failure - we had to re-nationalise Air New Zealand... privatisation's got a very chequered history," he said. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said managed isolation and quarantine hotels were run with strict rules and private organisations would have to follow them too. "Extension into private arrangements would have to fulfil very stringent public health criteria," he said. The minister in charge of isolation facilities, Megan Woods, said Victoria's Covid-19 struggles showed the benefit of having the military in charge. The government was not considering the idea of going private, she said. "At the moment we've got defence... police... security... as well as all the other staff at our facilities and that's absolutely critical to making sure our facilities are working well," she said. Business leaders said it could be possible to set up privately-managed isolation hotels by early next year. They're now drumming up support to come up with a plan to convince the government.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018758318/covid-updates-prudent-not-a-campaign-strategy-health-minister|2020-08-06|Health Minister Chris Hipkins says today's warning to buy masks is being made as a precaution, and a tracing card being tested will cost about $1 million. He, and Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield, today asked for everyone to have masks readyin updated guidance from the Ministry, and said people should prepare to wear them in case New Zealand went to alert level 2 again. The government also unveiled details of a covid tracing card to be tested in Rotorua. Hipkins told RNZ's Checkpoint there had been no evidence of any Covid-19 cases outside managed isolation facilities, but it would be wise to keep taking precautions. He said the country would be put into level 2 - requiring masks around other people and other actions - if there was evidence ofcases in the community. "We want to do everything we can to avoid going to Level 3 or Level 4. I would hope that all political leaders who are being responsible ...could at least unite behind the fact that we need to be prepared for future events, and we don't know what they may be - that's the nature of something like a virus. So we have to be prepared. "I think the responsible thing for all political leaders to encourage New Zealanders to be vigilant and to be ready." He rejected the idea that reminding New Zealanders about the threat of the virus was an election campaign strategy for Labour. "I don't think they need us to remind them. I think anyone who turns on the TV news at night and looks at what's happening ... Covid-19 is rampant around the rest of the world. "We cannot take six weeks off from our efforts there ... we have to remain vigilant and remain doing our jobs around this right up until election day." Hipkins would not say whether he agreed with the Director-General's statement that cases of Covid-19 in the community were inevitable. "I don't have a crystal ball, what I'm saying is we're doing everything we can to stop Covid-19 from coming across the border, to continue to do testing and contact tracing within the community, so that we identify and stamp out any Covid where it may pop up in the community. Labour Party spokesman for health Chris Hipkins. (File photo). Photo: RNZ / Richard Tindiller "We'll do everything we can to avoid there being further outbreaks, but we always need to be prepared. Everyone needs to be vigilant; we can't take for granted what we've done over the last sixmonths, we've got to keep working at it." He said the government was spending about $1 million on thecovid card, which wasinitially tested with the Nelson Marlborough DHB. The next step wastesting the tracking device with about 300 people in Rotorua. "The Covid Card is either a card or a dongle or something that you wear on your person - so most likely you wear it around your neck - and when you come into contact with other people who are wearing one, each of your cards will record that you've been in contact with that person," he said. "It's a good way of collecting data of who you've been in contact with, without necessarily tracking all of your movements. It means if you need to contact trace who you've been in contact with, if everyone else you've been in contact with is wearing one, then actually you've got quite a good record there." "We're going to look at how well it works and what the potential is for us to use it if we need to in the future." He said it was likely it would have to be widely adopted to work well, and the testers were looking at whether those trialling it would keep it on or if there wasany 'nuisance' factor that could reduceits use. "We're looking at the strengths and weaknesses before we make a decision about whether to deploy it more widely," he said. "All of these things are tools. Our contact tracing still relies on manual contact tracing through call centres and that's always going to be the case - what the Covid Card and what the app do, is provide better data to speed up that process." Hipkins said the Covid Card and app do notinteract, and thetesting group wasstill being chosen.

TOP freshwater policy launch at Cloud Ocean water bottling plant near Christchurch. Photo: Supplied Speaking at an event at the controversial Cloud Ocean bottling plant in Christchurch today, The Opportunities Party said governance of water could not be any worse than how it is now. Party leader Geoff Simmons said people were "shocked and upset" to hear that foreign-owned bottling companies are paying nothing for New Zealand water, and then "selling it on for a huge profit". "It's simply not fair to both iwi Mori and Kiwis who take pride in the supposed protection of our country's natural resources," he said. No-one wanted to start the discussion around who owned water, and it meant that water was being undervalued and sold off without the consent or approval of iwi, Simmons said. "If Mori were able to negotiate a share of the charge on these water bottlers, it has to be a better outcome for all Kiwis than all of the profits going overseas," he said.

Here is an explainer on the Act, who is eligible and how we got here. The origin of the word euthanasia is derived from Greek and means "good death" or "to die well, without pain". There are many different terms used to describe euthanasia, including assisted dying, assisted suicide, medically-assisted dying, death with dignity and more. Voluntary euthanasia is when someone who has requested help to die receives that help. Euthanasia is considered a crime under section 179 of the Crimes Act 1961. The law describes it as "aiding and abetting" suicide and it is punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment. It is already legal for someone to request that they are not resuscitated, should they suffer a medical event. It is also already legal for life support to be switched off. The Act gives people with a terminal illness (providing they meet all of the remaining criteria) the option of lawfully requesting help to die. In the Act, 'assisted dying' means: a person's doctor or nurse practitioner giving them medication to relieve their suffering by bringing on death; or the taking of medication by the person to relieve their suffering by bringing on death. Parliament has passed the End of Life Choice Act 2019, but it has not come into force yet. The Act will only come into force if more than 50 percent of voters in the binding referendum vote 'Yes'. It will then come into force one year after the date the result of the referendum is declared. To be able to ask for assisted dying, a person must: A person would not be eligible to ask for assisted dying if the only reason they give is that they are suffering from a mental disorder or mental illness, or have a disability of any kind, or are of advanced age. Under the Act, a person is able to make an informed decision about assisted dying if they can do all of the following things: If the eligibility criteria are met, there is still a requirement for two separate doctors to approve the request. It should be noted that within the Act, a health practitioner is not allowed to initiate a discussion about assisted dying. Once a patient initiates that discussion, their health practitioner must go through an extensive check-list with them, which is detailed in the Act. Once the practitioner is satisfied their patient meets the criteria, a second opinion from an independent medical practitioner is needed. If one, or both, of the practitioners, have doubts about the patient's ability to make an informed decision, an independent psychiatrist must also make an assessment. If any doctor feels that a person is being pressured into their decision, the process must stop. An eligible person can also choose to change their mind and stop, or delay, the process at any time. This isn't the first time euthanasia law has been considered. Attempts to introduce the law were made in 1995 and in 2003. Both failed to pass. In 2012, Labour Party List MP Maryan Street announced she was forwarding another member's bill to the ballot box. The proposed legislation was known as the End of Life Choices Bill. She then removed it from the ballot box before the 2014 election, over fears it would become a political football. When she wasn't re-elected, the party chose not to re-introduce it. In 2015, ACT New Zealand MP David Seymour entered his End of Life Choice Bill into the ballot box, after the Seales v Attorney-General case found that only Parliament had the ability to address assisted dying laws. The bill passed its first reading 76-44 in December 2017, its second reading 70-50 in June 2019, and its third reading 69-51 in November 2019. NZ First supported the bill in exchange for a referendum. Whether the Act comes into force, it will be determined by how the public votes at the binding referendum, held alongside the 2020 general election. A recent public poll, carried out by Research NZ in July shows there is a majority support for the law. Roughly 64 percent were in favour, with 18 percent saying they were not in favour. The rest were undecided. This is a softening in the level of support, compared with December last year. Figures at the time put 70 percent of respondents in favour of the legislation, while the number of those strongly in favour of the legislation dropped from 50 percent six months ago to 33 percent today. The End of Life Choice Act was subject to a conscience vote, meaning MPs can cast a vote guided by their personal beliefs, rather than towing the party line. But broadly in the third reading of the bill, the National Party voted 17 in favour and 38 against. The Labour Party was 33 in favour and 13 against. All members of the remaining parties voted in favour. The total vote was 69 members for and 51 against. All current leaders of the parties voted in favour of the law.

Horrified by last Sunday's Newshub Reid Research poll which gave it 25.1 per cent against Labour's 60.9 per cent, it did the only thing it could - it trashed the poll. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and National Party leader Judith Collins. Photo: Getty Images / RNZ That came after Newshub's Tova O'Brien had made the most of her story. "The National Party is in full blown destruct mode and Judith Collins has failed to steady the ship," said O'Brien. "In fact, she's sinking it to its lowest, darkest depths." Collins dismissed it as a rogue poll. "I don't believe it at all, I think it is entirely out of kilter, it's absolutely opposite to what we're hearing in the electorates," she said. "It doesn't go anywhere near where our own polling is." Her deputy Gerry Brownlee said that statistically one poll in 20 was wrong, and Newshub's was clearly an outlier. The party's leaders were saying what they could have been expected to say, but they seemed to be confident in their stance. The poll really was surprising. With an election result like that Labour would easily govern alone with 77 seats and National would be cut down to 32. David Farrar, a pollster who has been in the game for more than 20 years, said he didn't think it came close to reflecting reality. "There is no way there is a 36 point gap between the parties," he said on his Kiwiblog website. "The numerous polls I have seen and done have it way, way closer." Farrar does National's private polling, so he knows what's in them. Collins didn't reveal the private polling but there were reports that it has Labour on 47 percent and National on 36 per cent. When those figures were put to her on Morning Report, she replied "it's close to that". National had to wait until Thursday for better news on the poll front, and even then it wasn't anything they could celebrate. A 1News Colmar Brunton poll gave Labour 53 percent and National 32 percent. Collins didn't challenge it. "For the last couple of weeks I think you can see we've had to deal with some big issues," she said. "People want those things sorted. They've now seen those sorted and it's only onwards and upwards." One result that must have pleased her was the 20 per cent she scored as preferred prime minister, way ahead of what her predecessors Simon Bridges and Todd Muller achieved in previous polls. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was still uncatchable, out of sight on 54 percent. The 1News poll also gave Labour an outright victory with 67 seats against National's 41. The winner was ACT, which climbed to 4.8 percent and would have six seats. The party has had a steady climb in the polls, picking up support from voters drifting away from National and NZ First. The Greens were on 5.7 percent in the Newshub poll and 5 percent in the 1News poll, just clinging on, while NZ First rated an apparently terminal 2 percent in both. Labour does seem to be heading for a substantial victory on 19 September, and Massey University professor of politics Richard Shaw thinks there's a fundamental shift underway. In an article published by the Herald and Stuff, he said poll averages since May put Labour above 50 per cent and National around 30 per cent. "The political centre appears to be shifting to the left," he said. "When nearly two out of three voters in a naturally conservative nation support the centre-left, something is going on." Shaw said that in 2017 National secured nearly 45 percent of the party vote, and nearly half of that had bled away. "New Zealand has never had a single-party majority government but Labour could be on the verge of doing that," he concluded.

Its big announcement on a charging regime for returnees going into managed isolation was received with derision. The prime minister wisely stayed away from this one, leaving Megan Woods, the minister in charge of managed isolation facilities, to do the job at a press conference on Wednesday. Only people returning temporarily will have to pay $3100 for their two-week stay, and those who leave after the regulations come into force and then return from holidays or business trips. There will be a range of exemptions including on compassionate grounds for people coming here for a funeral or to visit a dying relative. The exemptions will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The scheme will recover less than $10 million and cost $600,000 to implement, just a fraction of the cost of managed isolation. The government initially considered charging all returnees but it ran into trouble. The Greens didn't want to charge anyone and NZ First wanted to charge everyone. Crown Law warned of legal challenges under the Bill of Rights Act which gives Kiwis an absolute right to return. When she announced the regime Woods emphasised, several times, that she had to stand up a system that would survive in the courts. It was fair and very important because taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for people who went away on holidays or business trips knowing they would have to go into isolation when they returned. The Herald headlined its report 'Rushed charging regime ticks all the boxes of dreadful public policy'. Stuff's Luke Malpass wrote: "It is rare to get a policy so pointless and so brazenly designed to appeal to people's prejudices as the government's quarantine and managed isolation charging policy." National had previously announced it would charge everyone $3000 and Collins said the government should be ashamed of itself. "I just think it's the sort of policy you have when you don't actually want to have a policy," she said. Winston Peters trashed the scheme but his party will vote for it when Woods has the unfortunate task of pushing a bill through Parliament under urgency next week. The Greens claimed they had saved thousands of people from being charged. Peters said Labour and the Greens were looking for overseas votes. Getting the legislation through won't be the end of it. Wait for the complaints and controversy over exemptions. Already TVNZ has one "heartbroken" Kiwi couple who live in England and want to spend time with the woman's unwell father. On Thursday the inquiry report on the leaked Covid-19 patient data was released. Michael Heron's investigation proved what was already known, that the Ministry of Health sent the list of patients to Michelle Boag, who sent it to Hamish Walker, who sent it to the media. It was done for political gain, Heron decided. Walker's explanation was new. He said he had been so distressed by being called a racist that he sent the list to media believing it would justify his claim that thousands of returnees from certain countries were about to descend on South Island cities. It didn't justify his claim. Boag has resigned from the National Party and Walker's political career is over. He isn't standing for re-election. The report has been forwarded to the Privacy Commissioner. It isn't known whether the pair will face further action. It gave the government another opportunity to have a crack at National. "It was a disgraceful and grubby act carried out by two National Party members for political purposes," said Health Minister Chris Hipkins. *Peter Wilson is a life member of Parliament's press gallery, 22 years as NZPA's political editor and seven as parliamentary bureau chief for NZ Newswire.

Photo: NZ Bird Atlas / DOC Sabine Bernert The area is home to native species such as the jewelled gecko, tree weta and banded dotterel or pohowera. Two years ago, the government launched an agreement with 14 groups to remove pests from 110,000 hectares of the peninsula by 2050. Eugenie Sage Photo: RNZ / Richard Tindiller Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage said new funding of $5.1 million will expand the scheme over nearly another 30,000 hectares. "The investment will allow large-scale pest control to be progressed over about 28,500 ha, expanding work under way in the Wildside project in the south-east of the Peninsula, and the internationally significant spit and dune systems of Kaitrete," Sage said. "These areas can be more readily defended against the reinvasion of pests." The work is expected to create around 15 jobs.  The announcement was made at an event on pest-free tamahua/Quail Island in Whakaraup/Lyttelton Harbour this morning. Funding for the project comes from the government's $1.3 billion Jobs for Nature package in response to Covid-19, which includes $76m for investment into community projects through Predator Free 2050. The work which would benefit many native species was supported by Ngi Tahu, she said. It will be managed by the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust and will put restoration of nature at the heart of economic recovery in Canterbury, Sage added. "Significant inroads have already been made on reducing possum and goat numbers on Banks Peninsula in recent years and there are long-standing successful trapping programmes. "I acknowledge what landholders working with councils and community organisations have achieved."
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/422956/national-promises-hpv-self-tests-more-funding|2020-08-07|National is promising to spend $20 million over four years on increasing testing rates and accessibility to clinical trials for gynaecological cancer if elected. National Leader Judith Collins says too many women are going untested and undiagnosed. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone The party said the funding would protect women from a disease that kills almost 500 people a year in New Zealand. Of that, $4 million would be used to fund a campaign to raise awareness of cervical cancer symptoms and $12m would be spent on increasing the number of tests by about 10,000 each year. The party is also promising to transition to HPV self-tests in its first term, which it said are more convenient and effective. The remaining $4m would be used to ensure more women have access to clinical trials to improve possible treatments. National Leader Judith Collins said too many women are going untested and undiagnosed. "National is focused on providing better outcomes closer to home for Kiwi families and communities. This funding will save lives and ensure New Zealand women are getting the care they deserve," she said. The policy is in addition to National's already announced plan to fund an independent Cancer Agency and set up a dedicated fund for cancer drugs, Collins said.
nuevazelanda|radionewzealand|https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/422886/government-to-trial-covidcard-technology-in-rotorua|2020-08-06|The government is going to trial CovidCard technology in Rotorua before making any further decisions about rolling them out nationally. Health Minister Chris Hipkins announced the trial today. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Health Minister Chris Hipkins says initial assessments by the University of Otago show the technology could make a decent contribution to the country's contact tracing. The Rotorua region will be used as a test case, involving around 250 to 300 people. This comes on the back of the government ramping up messaging around New Zealanders needing to use the Covid Tracer app, incase there's a second wave or community transmission. Hipkins says any decision on a wider rollout will be made later this year, and at this stage it's unlikely the CovidCard would be mandatory. "While manual processes remain the critical component for contact tracing, we know digital solutions can help make contact tracing faster and more effective. This is important from a public health perspective and also in supporting our economic and social recovery," Hipkins says. "It's fair to say that no single technology to 'solve' contact tracing has been identified anywhere in the world. That's why we need to explore all available technology options," he says. "We are continuing to improve the NZ CovidfTracer app, which includes looking at how technologies like Bluetooth can be utilised to further support contact tracing and have also been investigating the proposed CovidCard." Government Digital Services Minister Kris Faafoi says the government funded a trial run by the University of Otago in conjunction with the Nelson Marlborough DHB during lockdown. "The trial found the CovidCard works under controlled conditions, so we believe there is merit in exploring it further," he says. "After consultation with community leaders and iwi, we have selected the Rotorua region for a further trial involving around 250-300 p
