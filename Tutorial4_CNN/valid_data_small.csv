56852,27520, yes they are garish  though per wp redlinks they can encourage people to make new articles and help expand wiki  the only problem is that a lot of sis have names that don t match area names in reality  so it s tricky to find matching articles in many cases  a bit of local knowledge helps in that respect  to link colloquially named articles to formal names used by the government  up to you if you want to retain or remove them  there is no strict policy as to their use  only not to intentionally red link trivial things not notable enough to ever need an article  chat rff ,48d50b2116a853b6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

15840,98752, ai thanks for the message on my talk page no harm done  as i was offline of wp briefly at the time myself  and i learned a lot in the process of restoring and improving the article to wp notability standards  a lesson i ve applied elsewhere i also learned more about the wp distinction between primary and secondary sources the result is all to the good  i ll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing  though i think on first sight that the template s terse wording this article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past could be clearer as to its intent  does this really suffice to  in your words  let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason i hope so  though it was not obvious to me  it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue if you can see it that way  as a relatively novice editor might  perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect  with some procedural directives and relevant links  to the original prod and the policy guidelines for continuance i defer to your experience and good judgment  btw  since you liked kurzweil s other book  the singularity is near is certainly worth a skim  moore s law on steroids  a fascinating perspective  from ai s greatest optimist  thanks again  atama  and welcome back  ,1044166b24e08ccb,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
9319,29398,  please read unblock request carefully  this why i ask whoever read my request to read it carefully i will address your points in order of when your address them first  your said that you will work with the editor to help make the page notable  yet that is what i was asking for throughout the entire debate before i was  block for someone to help me make the page notable  i cannot help showing i was annoyed when everyone who posted on that debate was making negative comments and continued to push for it to be deleted  seen as i was the person making all the editing  it is the responsibility for administrators to assist me making all pages in question notable  i had already said sorry for the choice of words i ve made throughout the debate but again it is as if no one has the desire to care whether a user is remorseful of his action so long as the debate can continue  with or without them  second  if the only party that was trying to defend the case was  block  and prevent not only from actively defending the pages in question  but stopped from actually adding the references and making the page more notable  well i m sorry but i was doing my best all things considering  even before i was  block  from wikipedia  i did add in more reference  i read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes  however i am only one person and there is so much i could do before i can say i done my fair share  can someone help me finish this but clearly not  i really don t know wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do  but considering i have made many pages and edited many more in the short time i have started using wikipedia properly  i can say that i have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this  my point with this is that even though i have made massive contributions on here  there are things i do not know  and how to get pages back on wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them  so if you kindly give me details and links on how to do this would be most appreciated i still fail to see why it is disrupted behaviour to return pages back on wikipedia the way i have  a page before on ryan shamrock  fighter  was speedily deleted and then returned back on here  but not by me  and up until just today  no one has affected that  the user who is suggesting it has also recommended other pages for deletion  however  the user clearly doesn t know the fighters he wants deleted  as of them are have competed in either a major mma promotion or a second tier promotion  as he is doing such pointless acts  i still wonder why he s able to do this knowing he will get into trouble with other admins for the similar things i ve done  here is the link for this debate wikipedia articles for deletion ryan shamrock  fighter i get what you do mean when you say that it isn t about shark fights or ring of combat when it comes to this debate now  but none the less it is still an issue not to be ignored  ucmma cage rage uk was deleted for the same reasons that those two promotions  as well as a few other promotions on wp mmanot  should be  i find it amazing how these promotions are actually accepted by certain admins and are allowed to remain on there whilst a promotion i ve been helping with  that has a better laid out page than the others and was making the improvements the other users were screaming on about doing for it  yet it got deleted  whilst those others ones get treated like they are highly ranked promotions  ucmma cage rage uk has a weekly chat show on sky sports whilst showing their delayed timed events on sky sports i bet those other promotions don t even get tv time the head of cage rage uk never asked me to post those articles  i have always worked by myself to help them with their wikipedia page  never even expecting a thank you because i like their product and want to help other find reliable sources on them  which as many knows  wikipedia is the place for that  if you type in ucmma in the facebook search bar  find the one with a picture of the words  cage  on the top rage  in the middle  and  uk com  at the bottom  then like their page  then keep looking for any posts from carl gale  as i keep mentioning to look on wikipedia for ucmma cage rage uk information  fights at certain events etc  look as far back as the  st september you will clearly see that not only was ucmma not part of it  they were pretty much telling me that all their information can be found on their website and their facebook account so there was no need to continue doing it  however  i kept working on the wikipedia pages  making contributions whenever possible leading up until their ucmma hands of war event  once a few days went by after the event  the head of media for cage rage uk started to post wall messa,4dfe55daa920e23a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

114979,53246,oh dear rick  we are back your misunderstanding of what probability means i am not sure if we are allowed to discus this any more  perhaps it is ok on this page richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability  bayesian and frequentist although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument i am happy to discuss the mhp using either model but let us start with the bayesian perspective first to a bayesian  probability is a state of knowledge that is the definition of what bayesian probability means in the bayesian model  what is not known does not exist that is not something  that i have just made up  i am sure richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using wp or any good text book so  if the player does not know where the car is placed  or the host s door opening strategy  the probability of winning by switching is exactly it may be that the car is always placed behind door and the host always opens door but  if we do not know that  it makes no difference to our  bayesian  probability calculation  which depends by definition only on the information that we have the concept of average probability makes no sense  there is just  the probability  which is based only on our state of knowledge ,8e5792c728553a62,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

139784,36298,the text of the article could have been taken from tudjman era croatian propaganda press  the consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality  or revalue the widely accepted view of croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased  some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing  particularly the plight of the city s inhabitants of serbian nationality about half of the total number in the city subject to croatian military rule  or the very existence thereof  parts of the text are clearly self contradictory  the croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed  yet they still manage to down warplanes  and full of dubious propaganda cliches  the backbone of jna was broken at vukovar one does not need to be an expert on war in the balkans to note these shortcomings  naturally  this does not mean that we should subscribe to the serbian propaganda of the time an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from icty proceedings  from well known western reporters present at or near the scene  misha glenny and from other sources  actually  merely citing these sources will do a better service to the reader than this  numbers  we need sources and references for the numbers ,60fce7ccdf0b6b8f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

8461,45216,  now that is a heavily biased remark if i ever saw one  talk about racism  and no  arguments like korean is a nationality  not a race doesn t make my accusation any less valid  because then i would just say talk about anti korean bias or anti korean prejudice  true  appletrees may have some antagonism towards the japanese  though i suspect it s only towards ultranationalistic japanese who he she feels has affronted korean nationalism but making such blanket statements like the one above isn t any better  yes  i identify myself as korean as well  but i know idiocy when i see it  be it korean  japanese  or otherwise and just because everyone on this world uses sea of japan doesn t mean that it s not valid to investigate why  or to ask the question is that the right thing to do saying things like everyone on this world uses  sea of japan as if it were the end of the debate for something as nebulous as the way things were named in the imperialist era is not only intellectually stifling  but also works to limit free speech  ,78e77b50561f8359,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

421,60471,  ali  as i ve wrote  none of those authors are aware of many important details  such as kurekchay treaty an official and legal treaty which defined the entry of karabakh into russian empire  at the same time  the khan of sheki too signed a similar treaty  for example  i know michael croissant  and his book is full of mistakes and errors  his book doesn t mean much in this regard  his mistakes are too gross  the russo iran war started in whilst karabakh became part of russia in before such a war  meanwhile  tim potier is a good legal expert  and it is surprizing to see him write that  but everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of karabakh in th century was not his objective  the th century was  anyways  i do not know the khans of iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with british  if they did it in the zand period  they probably had full legal right at the time  since iran was more of a geographic entity  than political  same with azerbaijan  north it was geographic too  whilst i do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time  the later russian and british documents clearly identified azerbaijanis of the north as aderbeijani tatars i have evidence of that as far back as in british census estimates and in the official russian imperial census  same word is used by russian ethnographer velichko in his book  azerbaijani author  firudin bey kocharly wrote a book in literature of azerbaijani turks anyways  azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both iran and russia at the time  and some sided with either one side or another  unfortunately  you won t find much on that in libraries but just one such  trans lated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions  what is more important however  is that karabakh khan  khan being a turkic term derived from kagan was that it concluded its own treaty  that it minted its own money  one of the typical examples of independence and fought several wars with iran  some handily winning  others  like ambgiously  but still shah muhammed qajar gets killed  and i don t know who told you about vagif and ibrahim  by the later you probably mean ibrahim khan  right  well  vagif  the poet and vizier  was executed in after shah s death  and was executed by the temporary ruler  mamed bey jevanshir  who was nephew of ibrahim khan  while details are murky and contradictory  the qajars didn t have the primary rolse in this  indeed  once shah was killed  iranian troops withdrew  it screwed up all the plans to re conquering other parts of azerbaijan and georgia  meanwhile  ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error or so it is explained  in but anyway  the kurekchay treaty was signed by him  thus  once more  karabakh khanate  for one  was totally independent  and iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it  meanwhile  few other khanates were nominally dependent like poland was to ussr  or armenia to russia  russian speaker of parliament person in the country  openly called it forepost of russia whilst in armenia ,a1e13fc789597488,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

21139,105779, dear administrator this morning i edited derrick bell s page and added a link from a nyt article that state that one of his famous essays  the trade spacers is considered antisemitic by many people a few hours later  the addition was deleted i posted it again  and noticed that another user did the following march hj mitchell  talk contribs m bytes protected derrick bell  violations of the biographies of living persons policy  i found this action abusive as bell has been dead for months i proceeded to go to this user talk page and posted the following i find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that space traders is considered an antisemitic essay  even though there was a link to the original article from nyt where it was discussed and prominent professors like dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work  there is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people s philosophy  the reason that people have started shunning wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts  if someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that bell left the deanship at oregon law school because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school  i could understand that  but there are articles about his antisemitism  bell s page does not even include his racist comments about clarence thomas  the choice of clarence thomas replicates the slave masters  practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters  views  also  prioryman  name calling people you disagree with dunderheads really diminishes wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots the user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment  but deleted it i posted the following later march utc dear hj  do you represent the wikipedia censorship brigade  i do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what i did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are nyt article s about bell s antisemitism  as well as questioning why you locked the page since bell is dead  i am a simple person  the type of people that wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at bell s page and here are what sours people with wikipedia  is not it bigoted behavior for prioryman to call people that have opposing views dunderheads i am sorry but ypur behavior  as well as prioryman s  along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers  the facts are the facts  is not the gray lady a sufficiently legitimate source then that user pressed the bell so i will be  block i may have been naive and thought that senior members in wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues  i was not trying to harass or attack anyone to the contrary  i have been totally respectful of everybody  however  if the behavior that i encountered today is the typical behavior of the administrators senior staff  then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed  or it may be because hj lives in england where free speech is not allowed  as americans  that s one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended  free speech is what makes us different from europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish  instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in europe i am really surprised by this whole behavior  is this high school  or what  we are all adults and we should engage in conversation  not call mom when we do not like something  my ten year old does this  not an adult  ,35f437fca3cc80bf,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

30928,103260, if there is a credible link to a us gov t definition for the capacity of a tradable barrel of oil  then it should be referenced in the main article as the article states  there are several definitions for the capacity for a barrel or gallons i highly doubt that the us gov t is or was responsible for defining the capacity of a barrel of crude oil used for commerce  or that it is a world wide legal requirement to use a us gov t definition  but if there is any such legal requirement then again a reference should be stated in the main article to say that nymex has no legal right to define measurement units is a bogus argument what nymex has is the right to define or specify units that are pertinent to trade if nymex states that oil is to be traded in terms of barrels  then it is not illegal for nymex to state the capacity of this thing called a barrel in terms of unambiguous standard units  or to point to an authoritative source  authoritative as far as nymex is concerned  that defines the capacity of a barrel  ,28a0739954eca5f9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

2039,96781,  dear mr  bunkov  thank you kindly for your note  it is always a thrill to have someone working close to a certain subject to join the ranks of wikipedia editors  welcome again  i look forward to future cooperation  and i am sure other participants of wikiproject russia will be equally delighted  that said  i feel obligated to comment on the situation you are in  pardon me if you are already familiar with what i am about to say  but i feel it s safer to include it for the sake of completeness  since you are not an individual editor but rather a representative of a government organization  you should be extra mindful of wikipedia policies and guidelines covering your position  of which he guideline on the conflict of interest is the most significant  another important point is that wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia  so it s not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional  even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor  and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything  one cannot prohibit others from editing one s additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others  this  in fact  is one of the five pillars of wikipedia  this isn t to say that you must agree to each and every change others make to things you add  but all such disagreements should be resolved within the framework of applicable policies and guidelines  you ll notice  for example  that i ve made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the kaluga oblast article this is not because the style you used is somehow inferior  but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on russian oblasts  at any rate  style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance  and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of wikipedia s manual of style  you should not  however  be surprised when others fix it  style issues aside  wikipedia is all about content  of course  it s understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share  but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources  what this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source  and the source must be a reliable one  published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and or with editorial oversight  ultimately  this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources  and in your situation it means that sources produced by the government of kaluga oblast in general and by the agency for regional development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary  not secondary  source  primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts  but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed  in other words  it s ok to to use a primary source to back up a statement that kaluga oblast s grp in was billion rubles  but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like this demonstrates the oblast s high economic potential with formalities and general introductions taken care of  let s address your question about kaluga oblast somehow being a wrong  trans lation  that actually is not the case  the term oblast is a loanword in the english language  included in all major dictionaries  and it is much more precise than a more vague region territory or province this isn t to say that any of those terms are wrong they are not but they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as wikipedia s due to their ambiguity  this issue had been discussed on several past occasions  and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one  precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article s title  note also that all major english language reference works use the term oblast see  for example  encyclopedia britannica additionally  since the article about kaluga oblast is a part of the series on the russian oblasts  its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles  wp nccs is the applicable guideline covering all this  if you are interested in reviewing it  i hope this has been helpful  i apologize for dumping so much information on you all at once  but since your situation is different from that of a regular editor  i feel certain points should have been touched upon  if you have any further questions or need anything clarified  you are welcome t,05a5029cb75572f2,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

73508,10188,did christians invent satan  the idea that christians invented satan is lies  propogated by some adherents of wicca and other pagan believers  we see that the holy scriptures that came from judaism has a book called job  so why blame the christians rather the scriptures reveals in genesis how eve was tempted by the serpent  who had refused to worship adam  also later we see that david is tricked into taking a census by satan  old testament samuel  later on further we see that jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of beelzebul  satan  by pharisees  jesus refutes the accusations of the pharisees  in the nt we hear that i saw satan cast out of heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the west  so also in revelations we hear that there was war in heaven and st  michael and all the loyal angels to god fought against the followers of satan and the battle was won by the good angels  revelation also reveals  woe unto man for the devil has come down to earth  being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short  also elsewhere we hear that satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour  christ was tempted by the shaitan times after his baptism in the desert  so to say that we christians invented something which was already revealed in judaism and ot is silly and obnoxious  the devil had pride  then disobedience  then jealousy  then slander  then much later we learn that jesus called the satan a liar  murderer and thief  why dont the wiccans look to zoroastriaism or other dualistic religions and see the concept of good versus evil in those religions  why  so that the christians get the blame for something that actually exists  even the muslim believe in a the serpent called iblis  and even buddhists had a concept for the evil one called mara  who was a tempter  jesus even spoke to st  peter and said that the devil had been given permission to sift st  peter like wheat  whereby jesus siad that he had prayed for cephas such that he would not enter into temptation  the truth seems to be that the devil was an arc angel in heaven  who became too full of himself  later whe god created man in his own image  god requests all the angels to bow to adam  all do except for one angel  later called lucifer he refuses based on himself being made of fire and that adam is made of clay  however  god allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in job  some mention that in isaiah  o lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the heavenn is a direct reference to the devil  but i also consider it to babyloon  as in revelation  fallen  fallen is babylon the great etc  revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life  god has talks with the satan  so satan can not be inferred thence to be a non entity  as god does not talk to non entities  also some people believe that the dark side of human nature to be some impersonal evil  others realise that this is negative non sense  i know that people were possessed by demons  fallen spirits and that jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming  ha  jesus you nazorean  what hast thou to do with us  hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us jesus then would tell the demon s to shut up or be quiet  so far as i concerned the truth is in the holy bible  some truth is also in the quran  there are some truths to be found also in other religious books  but the whole truth is christ and the books of ot and nt are inspired by the holy spirit  have a read of revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from god  enough of this rubbish about christian inventions of spirits  pagans invented their gods  and invented strange myths concerning their false gods jew s and christians had the opposite  god revealed to them the truth and the way  and the life thanks email  james hernon hotmail com the next seion is not written by me  james hernon ,1af4e4f0a96b7619,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

153399,140806,wp triv does not say that trivia should not be on wikipedia  just that it should not be in greater focus than the article as a whole  and the difference between the editing you described and the anon edits i reverted was that the anon tag additions were the sole basis of his edit history  you have a varied edit history  also  the tag was put on articles that it clearly did not belong on  such as articles with relevant trivia in very small amounts  and pages that were explicitly labeled as trivia  wp triv says to be cautionary with trivia  not to remove it entirely  and if you interpret it otherwise  that is an issue to debate  the anon disrupted wp to possibly prove the point that trivia does not belong in wp  which is explicitly forbidden  now  i did not judge him solely because he was anon  but because of the massive amounts of editing done by an anon in a short period of time  without any variation whatsoever  no  being anon is not enough to condemn him  neither is a specific edit to a lot of pages  it is the fact that he is anon  an d doing a massive amount of edits and said edits are not fully constructive  the toomuchtrivia tag is only to be used when trivia is so numerous as to unbalance an article  some of the pages  like the bull shit article had very little trivia  and the trivia it had was rather constructive  also  there were some pages explicitly labeled as trivia pages that got the tag  this tag was abused in this case  on the individual articles  should editors feel that the tag was useful  as was seen on the wonderful life  kill bill  and dolly parton pages  i will respect that ,f1788307599e2334,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

34238,136976, leejc is absolutely right  he did a better job expressing what i tried to say back in june but while i agree with his final conclusion  it isn t quite the right argument to use  that we must assume the worst  to get it  so i thought i would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem  that seem to say the same thing  can lead to different solutions the ultimate cause of confusion is the math specific definition of the term event  when a random experiment produces a result  that result is not called an event  it is an occurrence  event is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property  so if i flip a coin a hundred times  there are only two possible events heads and tails  there will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event  and each occurrence will fit into only one event if i draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards  there are lots of possible events and or occurrences  some of them overlap  they include black card  spade  honor card  tjqka ace  and ace of spades  the occurrence black card can be in the event spade or club as well  note that an occurrence can fit into other events  but not vice versa  an occurrence of spade is also an occurrence of black card  but the event spade is most definitely not the event black card  since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events  the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied there is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event  it is called bertrand s box paradox suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes  each with two indistinguishable drawers  inside each drawer is a coin  box has two gold coins  box has two bronze coins  i can t resist the temptation to use the initials b and g and box has one of each  you pick a box at random  and open a drawer at random  if the coin is gold  what are the odds that the coin in the box s other drawer is also gold  i e that it is box the first issue here  common to story problems  is that this problem describes an occurrence  not an event  we must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are  to define the event  the set of possible occurrences  that defines the conditional probability the incorrect approach to bertrand s box paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities  box and box that the event matches the observation the box has at least one gold coin  this is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event  if you pick box then no matter which drawer you open  the occurrence is in the event the box has at least one gold coin  the correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin  every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event  remember  it s a set and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description  both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition  this set has three elements  not two  in two of those three possible occurrences  the box s other coin is gold  the correct answer is i have seen a variation of bertrand s box paradox used to represent the boy or girl paradox  you are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet  during the meet  you get a phone call from mr  smith  who is delayed and can t pick up his children after the meet  he says tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor  their names are sarah and  and the phone connection goes dead  there are four families of two children in the meet  and they conveniently include the four possibilities bb  bg  gb  and gg  what are the odds that mr  smith has two daughters this occurrence can be described as a two child family includes at least one girl  but not the event you need to use as the condition  mr  smith could have mentioned a boy s name first  and if that boy had a sister  that occurrence would have been an element of the set a two child family includes at least one girl  so that event fails one of the two criteria  you get the answer by erroneously using this event the correct event is just that mr  smith mentioned that he had a daughter  and compares to you opened a drawer with a gold coin in the box paradox  you can count four possible occurrences of that event  in two of those four  representing a single family  sarah has a sister  the correct answer is or if a conditional probability question describes an occurrence  and not an event  care needs to be taken whe,dccf0d4e6c9178c8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

39745,44723, passion killing in namibia introduction  in the cambridge advance learner s dictionary  passion is defined as a very powerful feeling  for example of  sex  attraction  love hate anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder  in this context passion killing is combined passion killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger  love hate  or other emotions in the past passion killing in namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend  recently  a large number of continuous passion killing cases have been reported  so far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women  breakups and infidelities being of the main reasons amongst many in this article i m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society  who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence the causes the question on everyone s lips is  why are men killing women amongst many causes  the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support  for things such as accommodation  tuition fees in a case of a student  food  clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case  men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits  the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women the namibian namibian another major cause that leads to passion killing in our society is infidelity from women  when a woman cheats and the men finds out  the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing  a possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women causes  who is at fault  as i have observed  both men and women are to be blamed in different cases firstly  certain men are at fault are because they don t seem to understand the real meaning of love  the country should cry out for help  true love is patient  love is kind it does not envy  it does not boast  it is not proud  it is not rude  it is not self seeking  it is not easily angered  it keeps no record of wrongs  love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth  love always protects  always trusts  always hopes  always perseveres bishop kleopas dumeni even if love is not involved  as it is in some cases  one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property in other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it  in the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing  women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost  but little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life  women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons  be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface  then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing recommendations recommendations  the solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this nation  knowing the diversity of people  it s hard to figure out what would impact certain people never the less  the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on  informante a number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty  but i believe one cannot fix another evil with evil so what is the exact answer to the problem  should we bring back the death penalty  will it stop the passion killings ,777d5df4aa68d581,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49930,62787, the press is free and will print what the hell they want the first proposition is dubious  what presses  set fit to print  is often a calculated judgement on  what the owners prefer  what advertisers on them won t object to  and what the readership that buys the paper would prefer to read  as one sees at critical moments  in the times of london  or the new york times  reportage can be devastatingly skewed  this goes for the mainstream press  the second proposition has nothing to do with either comprehensiveness or accuracy of reportage  but rather  who cares  i like it  i want the readership to think this way the murdoch press is a prime  and notorious example  it s old book  but written by walter lippmann  public opinion freely downloadable but is trenchantly eloquent on ther  pseudo environment  in which we are constrained to live by exposure to media analysis of the nature of news and of the economic basis of journalism seems to show that the newspapers necessarily and inevitably reflect  and therefore  in greater or lesser measure  intensify  the defective organization of public opinion this is what a great humane  liberal newspaper man could write about what really occurs in media  at the time  that was a centrist adminission of how much bull shit  is flogged to a gullible public to  manufacture consent  at w hate ver price to the facts  his position is held today by noam chomsky  whom lippmann s heirs regard as a dangerous man  in short  the classical moderate realist view of how information is cut and tailored to produce a social mindset is now only retained by those whom modern day centrists call extremists end of new year lecture ,a7fd155aae2f30f6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

137163,143099,the  arguments  above consist of reiteration  i also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation  certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production  which are also found in animation from other countries  whether the usa  korea  or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market this definition would exclude miyazaki  who  indeed  excludes himself  unlike his western fans likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition  yes  the ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as marvel dc superheroes  and certainly deserves a specific article  but this is not the same as tokusatu  ergo  tokusatu is not a genre  should not be so quick to assume what people do and don t know about  my original comment may have been sharp but was in response to an i will not be questioned tone  and i certainly know enough to contribute to this article  however  i strongly disagree with the classification and crufty tone and thus won t  usage on the japanese wikipedia does not have any bearing  the large number of separate articles on japan related topics that could well be included under the more general headings is definitely a fan driven form of exceptionalism ,fd444b6e6e5d25f3,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
