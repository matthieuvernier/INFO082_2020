6530,142583,  in an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool  which is called the interpreter and executed what command by command no interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays  taw from interpreted language talk some languages  like perl  are compiled at runtime  could you elaborate taw  every time a perl script is run  perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code  at least  this is the usual way of using perl  although it s not the only way  zundark dec you mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code taw i believe it s compiled to bytecode  much like java  as of perl version it s possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step  i think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well  but i m not as sure about that  indigo perl  http w indigoperl com  produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable  but i think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode  so they tend to be rather large  their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don t necessarily have the perl interpreter installed they have versions for both windows and unix ish platforms wesley old interpreted language article an interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code  but is interpreted at run time by the computer  and  trans lated into machine understandable code as required it is often a mistake to refer to a language as either interpreted or compiled because most languages can be implemented in either way  and some languages  like perl  are compiled at runtime but behave as if they were interpreted  other languages  like java  may be partially compiled into an intermediate form which is then interpreted  although that  too  might be compiled some languages  though  are specifically designed to favor interpretation an example of an interpreted language is javascript is java interpreted  or what the java programming language article says the first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability  and many implementations still do  these implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully compiled programs created by the typical c compiler and some later java language compilers  so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs  more recent implementations of the java vm produce programs that run much faster  using multiple techniques  the java language is compiled  always it is designed as a compiled language  and is implemented as a compiled language it is often compiled into bytecode  which is then interpreted  with a virtual machine i think the java language article is correct  but maybe it could be worded better ldc  yes  and you can also compile jave straight down to machine code if you like  the above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is imho incorrect  every language that has an eval statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code  you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code  axelboldt  way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of compiling it is used in two distinct meanings  as in compiled to machine code  or assembly compiled to byte code parse tree some other internal representation  i think it s wrong to call languages that use the second way compiled in such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use no language uses line by line parsing nowadays  all compile source to some form of internal representation quote from foldoc compiler a program that converts another program from some  source language or  programming language to machine language object code some compilers output assembly language  which is then converted to  machine language  by a separate  assembler ,faa8c48969b0d37f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

33759,5010, just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone  and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail in some cases it is probably appropriate  and actually used just like a surname  in a legitimate but different  broader sense than that used by our surname article  and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere  by the person that s probably especially true of radio personalities with an on air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name  i ve seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names but as a general rule  no  some like ann margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen  the problem  of course  is that our articles  especially the stubs and sub stubs  often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on if it is mary lou or something of the sort  common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname  especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself  it should clearly be under m in any category  the redirect which should be there  or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page  could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories  and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful but in between  there is a huge variety that you ll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories  and there are lots of them  even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn t even appear in the article s own name  ,0d4825e86a401840,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49653,83935, the main things i disagree about the haunted castle post  no one realized that lives had been lost until later that night  when firefighters searching one of the burnt out trailers discovered the bodies  thought at first to be mannequins  this is not true  this was reported in our local papers as well  the night of the fire  the media were told almost nothing  and had to go by rumor  i spoke to the fire chief  as well as numerous others on the scene that night  you see  except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers  where the walls were not made of plywood  everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash  the bodies were discovered before dark  as soon as the fire was extinguished  not much later in the night  the firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains  bones  blood  jew elry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile i ve seen the photos  additionally  the stench of burned flesh was overpowering  being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit  separated only by a chain link fence from the haunted castle trailers  wax mannequins would have been long since melted the truth is that the management at first claimed  and might have believed  to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the hc  and there was no reason to close the park  the  castle was isolated  so the fire couldn t spread to other buildings  the fire was out by and the park closed at p m  i ve never heard of sfga kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night  with fair weather with a free return pass  an unprecedented decision was made and implemented in minutes  given this time frame  they clearly found the bodies instantly  and there wasn t time to think that they were mannequins eight days after the fire  a statement by the ocean county prosecutor s office said a year old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses  the boy told the police that he had been befriended by a year old boy at the castle s entrance  he said the older youth  who appeared to be familiar with the castle  offered to guide him through  he said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light  and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam rubber wall pad  the prosecutor exonerated the older youth  who has never been identified  of any criminal wrongdoing  police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning  and interviewed both saturday may th the younger boy s parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast  the older boy was turned in by his teacher  who had seen him unattended  exit a burning haunted castle  and alerted police as soon as he could  this boy set numerous fires  bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it  try to reproduce such a thing  it takes about seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam  it is unclear why the prosecutor didn t go after him  according to news reports of the trial  no such boy was ever found  and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy  under cross examination by the defense  the witness denied starting the fire himself  although its true as it is quote from the article  the identity of the boy was well known to investigators i think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill fated group  the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property  as well as numerous other facts thanks  ,e09541c11b335fa6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

29685,143053, i never said they would be expelled i said they do not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout the only way an avowed homo sex  can both understand and agree to live by the scout oath and law is to lie of course  he is also violating his promise to be trustworthy in the process  he does not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout he intentionally violates the scout oath and law  and he intents to continue violating the scout oath and law but he could join and remain in scouting nonetheless  by telling lies i imagine  at any given time  there are thousands of scouts who are regularly violating the scout oath and law  who intend to continue doing so  and still remain in scouts but that doesn t change the fact the scout oath is what it is  that bsa believes that homo sex  behavior violates the scout oath  and that these scouts are not qualified to be scouts  the first amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group s policy to be  expressive association the courts may not interfere on the ground that they view a particular expression as unwise or irrational and beliefs need not be acceptable  logical  consistent  or comprehensible to others to merit first amendment protection the fact that many scouts disagree with bsa beliefs  ignore bsa beliefs  disobey bsa beliefs  or that anyone finds bsa beliefs to be inconsistent  irrational  or unwise  does not take away bsa s right to assert and hold their beliefs  ,fcf1d8b8d185a3bb,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

99946,148404,in response  dear lessheard vanu and to wikipedia including all editors and administrators mr  wales this is a very serious issue we contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia s own editors and administrators as with blackpearl who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don t apply to her  and with other editors who uphold double standards  then when challenged to the double standards  including blackpearl s violation of wikipedia s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control  other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia s own written polices  lessheard vanu had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a harassing the editor outright agreeing with blackpearl then in addition to ip address being  block all talk discussion are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors administrators  all of this has been recorded  including that blackpearl having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page  copies have been secure that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her these statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia s own written polices and purpose yet you have ignored that as previously written in discussion  per wikipedia s own written polices  but immediately deleted by blackpearl and then sanctioned by lessheard vanu blackpearll calls herself evidently mrs  johnny depp and pirate lord ess and such she celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean for wikipedia  why would someone devote so much time to check the site and on these pages  and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn t follow her bias views vandals  attackers and such  has her judgement become impaired her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean is very clear that is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia s own written polices sorry  but if one purchases products  such as pirates of the caribbean posters  toys and walt disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia wikinews articles  doesn t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest  as recorded  blackpearl s pages regarding this issue are one sided  not neutral  are bias  in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean  yes  pirates of the caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral  they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the walt disney company  following wikipedia s own written neutral policy  entire articles would have to be deleted  yet blackpearl continues to violate wikipedia polices and purpose  then with ip s being deliberately  block  and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things  if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to pirates of the caribbean following wikipedia s own written polices  editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason  to delete those articles and ban the ip user  they use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts  it s a total lock out by the editors and administrators  abusing their trust tools  acting like a private monarchy  to date  blackpearl s has proven she has ultimate control  has repeatedly stated that is her purpose  and had even sought to have the articles locked  then you lessheard vanu wrote that you don t want to lock these articles  stating it goes against company policy  but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as vandals and harassing the editors etc other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include svtcobra and whoville and chris mann we have documented that they say one thing  yet practice another  we have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers  we contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and admin,4bdace3027e6e2fd,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

45073,103593, september utc  the only lesson i learned for about the umpteenth time is that wikipedia is a complete pile of garbage  which is why i edit from an ip and can t even be bothered to create a username that grand slam article is a great example of everything that s wrong with wikipedia it s a terribly written article in which two authors are responsible for almost the entire content i nicely corrected a false statement  which you reverted  and then you edited to no longer be false  but instead completely unnecessary and redundant you refused to accept an edit to your page  threatened to report me to admins  crying to mommy  for accusing you of owing the page  when you and one other user wrote the entirety of the content and refuse to accept corrections  even when the corrections aren t even a matter of content but rather the awful writing on the page i ve come across other people on wikipedia who revert all edits to their pages and it s ridiculous that this behavior is tolerated i can switch my ip address whenever i choose by resetting my router  i only appealed the block because i want to report that awful page to the baseball project and want it to be internally consistent  you are completely delusional if you think putting an edit war template on the page of someone who page two edits and threatening to report them to the admins for their first edit is anything other than spreading all this vitriol of  hate i sincerely hope you really are a child and not an adult  because if you re an adult and act this immature  you are in need of serious help ,2a452e4672b85e2d,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

27279,86679, hoover s murder investigation re kennedy the information about hoover s role in the murder investigation of president kennedy is well documented hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of president john f  kennedy which is often called the crime of the century  the first citation in the kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the house select committee on assassinations  it issued its report in after a three year investigation into the assassination of john kennedy  martin luther king  and robert kennedy  the report by the congressional committee was critical of the performance by the fbi as well as other agencies  the second citation in the section on the kennedy murder is to the pbs frontline news show  it was reviewing the official government records that electrified top washington insiders and have been kept secret for over years  these secret documents were obtained by the assassination records review board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure  the once secret documents are fascinating  especially as reviewed by pbs  hoover conferred with nicholas katzenbach of the justice department about how to approach an investigation of kennedy s murder  the former attorney general was grilled by the hsca years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in kennedy s assassination  the copy of his memo is carried by lancer if the reader wants the full version of the testimony by katzenbach the reader should go to the house committee report president johnson  along with hoover  also knew about the oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be oswald trying to contact a hit man  maybe there would be another motive for impersonating oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him  i don t know what it would be  there is no question the fbi  under hoover  acted as the primary investigative arm of the warren commission  and hoover testified to the commission as seen from these once secret  trans cripts of the warren commission hearing i have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of president kennedy the testimony is unsealed now there is no secret anymore about the fbi destruction of evidence  they were caught and its now public knowledge  there is a full pulic record  the agent involved even wrote a book about it  the american public does not believe the conclusions reached by the warren commission and believes the government has something to hide this is what the assassination records review board believes  conclusion  therefore  any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in  one should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn t like it  if that were the criteria for deleting information  then wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country  nothing negative can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a theory  no  the information is documented by reputable sources what i can t figure out is why mr  hoover s  sex  life gets so much space  and yet someone doesn t want information on hoover s job performance on the biggest case of hoover s career  ,e7d218d5fb8777ed,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

38794,50575, ok  the convention on naming appears to be falling by the wayside  some cities articles  ie  toronto  montreal  are titled as the city s name only while others  chicago  winnipeg  calgary  vancouver  are burdened with having the state or province following the city in the article title  in response to your omment below the full name of toronto is toronto  ontario  canada which is unnecessarily long as an article name  besides  wikipedia articles use the most common name  not the full name of article subjects  e g united states  not united states of america and united kingdom  not united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland wikipedia is an international encyclopedia  not a north american one  so the article title should be what readers around the world will think of first  not just those in north america  many people outside of canada have not heard of ontario  even though they know about toronto  let s just leave keep it simple  and keep the existing redirect from toronto  ontario to toronto ground zero t  and seeing that you are administrator please re name the winnipeg  manitoba  calgary  alberta  edmonton  alberta  and vancouver  british columbia articles to winnipeg calgary edmonton and vancouver respectively their full names ie  winnipeg  manitoba  canada  are unnecessarily long and readers worldwide know of these cities even if they have not heard of manitoba  alberta  or british columbia  as you suggest  let s keep it simple  we should not imply that toronto  montreal  and ottawa  by the way  both vancouver and calgary are larger than ottawa  are in a different league  so let s say that all canadian cities of over should stand on their own  we ll make up our own rules as we go along  thanks  i hope you are able to do this soon  ,873cbd73498b3f20,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

116885,114347,oops i was just about to post this before you posted yours i might as well anyways furthermore  as far as internal textual evidence goes  there are certain things which clearly show that this could not be the work of ptolemy for example  several of the aphorisms make explicit references to horary astrology  which is not something that ptolemy addressed at all in the tetrabiblos one of the reasons for this  among others  is that interrogational astrology  ie  horary  was not developed until the  nd and  rd centuries and this development occurred in india within the hindu tradition see pingree pg horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of hellenistic astrology from which ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on  and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the middle ages when the various arab and persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the indian  persian and hellenistic traditions so you see  even the internal evidence in the text itself with the references to horary show that this could not have been the work of claudius ptolemy ,639814cb943eca41,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

15823,86457, aha  so  it is not about bessarabia  it is about soviet demands over bessarabia  i think this is the core issue of numerous misunderstandings  if we start from analyzing what the soviets demanded and see that romania and the west did not made sufficient steps to apease it  we observe insuficient action from the side of romania  did not organize a referendum as well as from the west  did not succeed in overthrowing the reds to try is not enough but also we run into which obviously ties the hands of romania  w hate ver you say  it was much more important for romania to have normal relations with the rest of the world than with russia but i said from early on  that bessarabia  not russia is the center of the issue  it is bessarabians that chose this or that  not romania or russia  russia had intervened only in without being invited by a local body or by mps from bessarabia  without even a mock support from inside bessarabia  why should russia s demand be treated supperior to bessarabia s choice  good or bad  it was a choice made in full awareness the  military  treaty you mention was signed in february  i e  before march between two neighboring to bessarabia countries  it can not possibly tie the hands of bessarabia itself  by then an independent country about autonomy  as far as i know  after the november  resp december union of bukovina  resp trans ylvania  a government was set for the entire united romania  led by a  trans ylvanian politician  alexandru vaida voevod he was too liberal for the phanariot minded politicians that used to govern in bucharest before  they tolerated new romanians in government only becuse the circumstances made that necessary  among other things  vaida started a large campain of land reform  widely supported also by bukovinians and bessarabians  but very feared by the old ruling elite in bucharest  recall the peasant uprising  still very fresh in mind they tollerated vaida s governments  there were or i think  for ca year  and in early a black coalition was formed  and general averescu became prime minister  similar to the one formed in romania in early against basescu  which lamenably failed within month  but dragged the country more into politicianist discourse until last autumn land reform was limited and only went as far as to finish what was started  the new constitution of was written by these people  who put the word unitary everywhere they could fit it into  thus the autonomy of all three new provinces was not enshrined in the new constitution  in return that led to a bitter division of the politics  on one side national liberal party of bucharest old politicians  on the other the  trans ylvanian dominated national  r  nist party  in the latter started to gain momentum  and to sealed it they brought in carol ii from forced exile  but carol ii turned to be even worse  so they actually shut themselves into leg  so to say  that led some of them to more nationalistic discurse  for example vaida himself dahn even calls him fascist  which is not true  but i don t want to argue with dahn others managed to escape this trap  for example maniu you see  you have to take into consideration the entire going ons  bessarabia was left without regional autonomy because no other province got it  which in turn was because the old phanariot mineded people carried the day in early s  these people lost the grip on power  but it took time  even in modern romania you still have the continuation of the same disputes  on one side you have many politicians asking for setting up regions and more local autonomy  again  surprisingly many  trans ylvanians among them on the other side you have the command system minded partly communist foprmed bureaucracy  who fear regionalization  again  surprizingly many oltenians and other likes of them among but unlike the interbelic period  it seem that now the movement is strictly oriented in one direction  regionalization and greater local autonomy is inevitable  whether you bring the eu standard pretext or not  so  my second part of the answer is  if it were not for the soviet occupation  the rise of fascism  and wwii  we would have had autonomy for bessarabia  with a powerful local legislative body  by s  communism only created a pause  things continue to roll today talk  ,e73ec52b13786c3f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

5316,54656,  i m enjoying the holiday  the nice thing about beating your head against the wall  it feels good when you stop  why should i put up with the sons of betacommand  when i can work at source with charles matthews  i am not alone  just go look at all the veteran editors at other projects who won t come back  look at all the expert editors  who stopped editing because they were bitten  this attitude that editors are a dime a dozen  is a limiting factor in the quality of wikipedia just so we re clear this is about interpretation of policy  not policy itself we have editors nominating for deletion  because a fair use image would make it harder to email and get a free image  we have editors nominating for deletion  because in the era of digital cameras  a free image of the recently dead must exist  look harder we have editors nominating for deletion  because an image in a book exists  go scan the book even it was printed in and the photographer is unknown  this image would be challenged at commons since the source and copyright status is unknown  we have editors nominating for deletion  because the newspaper photo could be a commercial source although no proof of commercial source exists we have admins removing fair use images from articles without discussion  then letting the bot delete the new orphan image  i m curious why i should agree to anything  what is my motivation  as a counteroffer  i will agree to a month topic ban  if a permanent interaction ban is agreed to  with editor b  and b they will not comment on my talk  they will not nominate my uploads  since they do so little work in article space  i can stay away from them  if the policy is so clear  another admin can handle it  and it will remove even the perception that a personal agenda is being pursued here turning the tables since this is the popular sophistical trick  why would i want to come back  what can you offer me to edit here again  i ve quit aversive leadership for money  why would i want to put up with it for free ,92144f50666492f1,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49979,6733, the punk rock page has more meat in the text and its a lot of text content then a photo so the glance is in favor of the text i do see some areas that can be fleshed out i think the hardcore page wouldn t work with every section in depth like theirs  thats what makes this page also unique to hardcore but i do think that some sections here are too small and that would work to balance out the photos to keep the text the main teaching and learning tool i would like to resize the photo of zines a little smaller even if it has to be re uploaded then it might now be too much and too busy people read to retain information the right set up enhances that too many pictures are a distraction they take away from the knowledge more fleshed out sections can help ill brainstorm on that until later i guess add the picture  if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little  maybe it will balance itself out more  the third option is we can fill out some sections more make it more balanced and then add the zines  photo  after  so it accentuates and isn t the meat and potatoes of the section the sections of influence on other genres that could be good place to start adding more content depth ill study some other pages meanwhile when i get a chance then bring that knowledge here a little later thanks a lot i love to share knowledge and i like sharing that here for free ,11f01d2923b49137,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

117778,114,paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however  the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate  invertebrates  radiolarians  sponges  plants  pollen  foot prints  etc and multiple processes may include permineralization  recrystalization  carbonization  replacement  dissolving  diagenesis  etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue  however quick burial is not questioned the major question is  how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab  which of course implies that given the right conditions  vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood  but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet  how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with ,004b975fabbbffa9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

53179,79476, utc i agree with user man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading see this quote about  or maybe from edward tufte before the development of spreadsheet graphing  the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist drawn d images with the height of d objects representing the magnitude of the data points in these charts  both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points the effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude source the image suggests that the tsar bomba  which was three or four times more powerful than castle bravo  is actually times larger in volume  or x larger in area if explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield  not really accurate  but much closer than this chart  the tsar bomba mushroom cloud would be x taller than castle bravo and x taller than hiroshima instead  the diagram shows the cb and tb over a thousand times taller  on this scale  one could conclude that since the hiroshima bombing s mushroom cloud was about four miles high  the tsar bomba explosion x taller  must be larger than the earth itself july ,d4a81de0018d6383,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

91783,90379,i have just read the source  i think you are very right  it is about global health but again not about medical tourism which is a subcategory of globalized healthcare driven by the patient movement  for example the reference article starts with the example of dave who had traveled to tanzania as a part of global health rotation  in this case  tanzania is neither the medical destination nor the developed country with collapsed or collapsing social health care system therefore no interest to medical tourism studies  it is clearly not relevant to the medical tourism  i think if medical tourism would be defined with economics terms such as imports and exports  by the way i do not like it in this way  just to clarify we might not be so confused  like developing countries  medical tourism destinations  are the exporters and the developed countries are the importers  i would suggest to remove such texts and references which are out of topic  even though some of them are quite interesting for other studies ,f1dfec6c9fe04ca6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

12345,156993,  true  caste community related stuff are really difficult to grasp immediately given the complex nature of indian society  i can understand that you need more time to fully analyse the issue  take your own time and i am always there to help you in case you need more references we have agreed to maintain the original content till the discussion is over  an anon have edited the article without any references and you have reverted it partially  change it back to original content as of nov by the way  any updates from your side you can take your own time but make sure to maintain the original content we need to maintain the original version till the dispute is resolved  anonymous edits and partial reverting will only lead to more confusions  if people continue to edit  i propose to remove all caste names from the article till the dispute is resolved  sorry  i thought that i had fully reverted the ip  anyway  i ve read all the english items  in some cases more than once i can see that the gounder community phrase is used in the sense of meaning the kv community  but that is only apparent if there is a hook in the article to give it some context  eg  an article talks abour the kmk  you know that kmk kv  and so when it then says gounder community then the context makes it is obvious that they mean kv  i ve not explained that particularly well  but short version  yes  in the examples gounder community kv the problem is  that is not good enough  you cannot prove that the term is not used to refer to other groups of gounder than the kv  nor could i find a really clear cut example among the english language sources  all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background eg  that kmk kv party  sure  you know that but someone born bred in the uk or usa  germany or guatemala  australia and austria most probably will not  in that sense  you are engaging in synthesis  and we are not allowed to do that here you said that the tamil sources were important  are they really going to resolve the issues that i raise  in particular  is even one of them going to explicitly say that the term is used either always or most frequently to refer to kvs none of them will say  gounder always refers to kvs because there are other communities too that are using the title  but you need to view from another angle  why other communities  non kvs  are not referred as just gounder community because  all the sections of vettuvars  vanniyars  vokkaligas don t use gounder title  only some sections of those communities use the title and hence they cannot be generally referred as gounder community  this gives the freedom to refer kvs as gounder community  all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background eg  that kmk kv party this is not very difficult  we can attach this reference along with other references to prove that kmk or kmp kv party  anyway  if this not enough  here is another reference which says about gounder community  taken from deccan chronicle persons belonging to kongu vellalar are mentioned as persons from gounder community to prove that  gounder community mentioned here refers to kongu vellalar  i have attached the proof here  which says sengottaiyan is a kongu vellalar  no need to infer from kmp or kmk  this reference will directly establish that gounder community mentioned refers to kongu vellalar  user mahevenki mahevenki,d6bc89bb80146d8f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

17681,48899, at the very least  there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of munsell chips  one that is in the public domain is at the server was awfully slow when i tried to access the links with the ascii data files  i had better luck with click the squares for reflectance data  this website is cited in  for instance fernando ayala  jos f  ech  varri  pilar renet  and angel i  negueruela  use of three tristimulus values from surface reflectance spectra to calculate the principal components for reconstructing these spectra by using only three eigenvectors  j  opt  soc  am  a abstract the article cites the website above as ref one of the classic sources also cited in the paper above seems to be  kenneth l  kelly  kasson s  gibson  and dorothy nickerson  tristimulus specifications of the munsell book of color from spectrophotometric measurements  j  opt  soc  am abstract the kuehni book i mentioned above lists a bunch of other sources  you can browse it search inside if you have an amazon com account  used at least once to purchase something from amazon com itself here incidentally  i now realize that these sources may give enough information to settle the very question i posed  but to really settle it  i would first need the answer to the following  was i wrong in the identification of the munsell s color in my initial posting  that is what is the identity in the munsell system of the munsell color to which the wikipedia article is referring  is it in fact  rp having realized my probable mistake above  now i don t understand something else  look at this statement in the article professional artists  following munsell color system regard purple as being synonymous with the red violet color shown at right  in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet in what sense are artists supposed to be following munsell here  obviously not in nomenclature  is it the case that the artists do use munsell s colors in their work  but change the names  e g  munsell s purple artist s violet  and munsell s red purple artist s purple i d rewrite this if i understood what is attempted to be said here  ,82bb3f5417d76358,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
30194,156431, i think you have done a great job with the page  and i learned a lot from reading it and the other comments posted above i like that you were able to make use of some of the information we covered in class specifically related to this topic  but were also able to include plenty of outside resources many of the concerns i had have been addressed in prior comments  but there is one section that i find slightly unclear it may just be the way i am reading your wording  but i figure there is always a chance that someone else will take it the same way and have the same question i do in the toxicology studies section  i think your intention is to say that because the mouse study used very high doses of the protein and proteins that will be toxic are usually toxic at very low doses  evidence supports that the bt toxin is not toxic to mammals  what i initially read  however  was just the phrase research on other known toxic proteins suggests that proteins are usually toxic at low doses  further suggesting that bt toxins are not toxic to mammals which confused me by making it sound like the toxins are almost always toxic at low doses and that the bt toxin might not be safe perhaps changing this wording would help clarify your meaning for future readers just a thought overall  great job  ,ce1b94f62116fcd9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

26749,87935, hi  i was just wondering why you removed my edit on the mackem rivalry page what i added  i believe to be a fact perhaps we could work on making it more neutral if you thought it may offend anyone i am originally from south shields  which is more or less equidistant from the rival cities i am currently however  living in middlesbrough the rivalry in south shields is slightly more noticable since it is geographically and socially directly in the middle  and also because it has more of a mix of necastle united and sunderland afc supporters the rivalry is especially evident in the new town of washington as it seems  i might be wrong  to have approximately an equal amount of geordie and mackem residents i don t want to offend anyone  however  i believe my edit should be included in the article in some form  as it is true that there are a considerable amount of people in both newcastle and sunderland who don t have a clue about the origins of the rivalry they tend to attribute it entirely on football  or in extreme cases  for no reason at all sometimes  whenever a geordie or a mackem makes a reference to the rivalry  i question them most of the time  their response was just don t know why  or because they are scum  and cound not give a reasonable argument let me know how you feel about this  take care  ,eb2fe811bb015c00,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49630,78952, the link you provide states that of the rail market in sweden is privatised that therefore makes saying rail  trans port in sweden is privatised a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government  it doesn t matter whether the rail market was liberalised into different companies under state ownership e g  sj  something cannot be described as privatised if it retains a majority of government ownership  because it is therefore nationalised  the opposite of privatisation  to describe the swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written  rail  trans port market is privatized and companies include sj in this sentence you have made it sound as if sj is a private company which is untrue  since if the person reading clicks the sj hyperlink  they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that sj is a government owned enterprise a much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger  trans port by rail in sweden is operated by state owned companies such as sj as well as the government run lokal trafik in place within each of sweden s l  n such as hallandstrafik  storstockholms lokaltrafik  sk  netrafik etc  etc  etc  and then to explain that some sectors of rail  trans port are privatised such as the  trans port of cargo  this would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above  which states that the majority of rail  trans port in sweden is still government owned  with being privatised since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned  you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned sj isn t the most efficient of rail networks  something which a lot of swedes themselves agree on as far as i have seen  in my own experience delays are common and travelling with sj can be expensive june ,d347113beb94f317,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

22802,44174, editor review hey nish  i m currently up for editor review  i would be most appreciative if you could comment on my wikipedia habits there and offer some advice  thanks in advance  thanks for the editor review  i honestly  truely know that i do not want to become a wikipedia admin  however  i hold the same thoughts towards wikipedia as i do towards the us military  given the choice  i would never join up  but my personal philosophy of national service  i agree with the idea of mandatory national service of some sort  whether it be community service or military  compels me so that i plan to join the us military in some form in the future  the problem i currently face with wikipedia is that i m constantly fighting an uphill battle in both the preservation of information and the adding of new information to wikipedia  often  something that i hope to be small edit becomes a huge issue due to vandalism  edit wars  extremely overly burecratic wikipedians  example  those who like to delete almost every image from topics under the fair use policy etc  i don t want to end up like many of the former admins who came to wikipedia to add information and stayed because they became admins and spent all their time putting out fires  however  as wikipedia will experience exponential growth within the next decade  it will plateau when the internet finally reaches into the third world in a big way and with that growth will come a huge number of vandals  honestly  i believe wikipedia now can use x the number of admins  i can t even imagine how bad it might get on here  with vandals  in a decade or so when the number of admins has grown at a steady pace but the number of vandals is huge due to the rapid growth of wikipedia and the internet in general i would prefer to not be an admin  but i m willing to put up with w hate ver it takes to preserve the good info of wikipedia while ensuring that new info can be added properly any thoughts on this edit  also  i d like to expand my vandal fighting activities  but i m not sure if i should get external programs like vandalproof  i do patrol newpages every now and then  and in the process catch many vandals  however  i usually cannot punish these vandals because of the wp agf policy and the fact that warnings really do nothing to repeat vandals  i ll try my best  alexander litvinenko you left this comment on my talk page  umm you stated that you shortened the intro here as per wp lead  we were discussing the intro on the talk page  and i would have appreciated it if you would go back and discuss the intro s status on the talk page  i am restoring back the intro section  and you can make minor changes if you wish  but please don t make drastic changes without discussing  thanks  by the way  keep up the great work with the article  hopefully we can pull this to ga or fa in the near future  best  nishkid i ve discussed the article on the talk page  the introduction is way too rambling and detailed which is why i shortened it  please read wp lead which recommends it is concise  also some of the sentences don t flow well  the first sentence was a russian security service agent  with a link to fsb  and later a russian dissident is a much better summary than was an ex fsb lieutenant colonel with kgb experience in fighting organized crime  tom in order for the article to have more impact it needs to be more concise you restored back the intro  i e  a major change and said i could make  minor  changes if i wish but  had to discuss drastic ones i hope you realise this is hypocritical  given that you did a major revert without discussing as you know  several people on the talk page have suggested to you that the intro was too long i promise you  the shortened introduction looks and reads better than the longer one the longer one does not summarise what he was in the first sentence including his dissidence  it goes straight into a narrative without any gap after working in it doesn t make sense in english his superiors had ordered for the assassination should be his superiors had ordered the assassination you can t be a dissident of an organisation  see dissident it s got several long contiguous paragraphs instead of short clearly defined ones  anyway  hope you re okay  give us a shout and we can talk about it  it was that you said  don t make drastic changes withou,75f6b25f9cf879d1,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
