51290,45663, this poorly written wiki article attempts to make it appear that ancient macedonians were distinct from ancient greeks  i would gambit the article is largely edited by people from fyrom republic of macedonia with irredentist aims towards greece  contrary to both us and un resolutions to refrain from propaganda against greek macedonians despite the occasional voice of objections there is no major dispute among most scholars that ancient macedon was inherently greek in nature at least more than anything else  the hellenic age  the greek word for what we in english call greek is evidence beyond dispute of this  to give an example of historical distortions found in this article  macedon or macedonia  greek makedon  a  was the name of a kingdom centered in the northern most part of ancient greece  bordered by the kingdom of epirus to the west and the region of thrace to the east  by saying the northern most part of greece it makes it seem like it bordered greece  there was no greece state in ancient times  there was only a collection of autonomous city states and kingdoms that self identified as greeks mycenae  athens  argos  ithica  sparta  macedon corinth  etc  another example of irredentism  the wiki article states  it became increasingly atticised during this period  though prominent athenians appear to have regarded the macedonians as uncouth this statement is very deceptive  it was common during times of conflict for greeks to label each other barbarians non greeks  as an insult similar to saying unamerican today while demosthenes used barbarians to describe macedonians  he also used it describe the athenean orator aristogeiton  aristophanes  nephelae line and even demosthenes himself as described by as a barbarian by aeschine  plato characterized the lesbian aeolic greek dialect as a barbarian register while addressing pittakos of mytilene  athenaios vi a  socrates calls strepsiadis strepsiadis was a well known athenian protagoras etc  etc  there are countless instances of greeks describing each other as barbarians  there are other examples of bias in the article but the most telling is how it lightly brushs over the hellenic period of macedon  similiar to the golden age of athens in which macedonia spread the greek language  greek culture  and greek ideas to the region  they unique flavour of macedon among greeks  was very similar to how athens also had unique aspects to it  as did sparta  as did most of the greek mini states  if macedon wasn t greek  then greek philosopher aristotle wasn t greek either  since he came from chalcidice in macedon to go down this road we would also need to rewrite a fair portion of wiki articles related to antiquity and the hellenistic period  to do this to suit the political needs of a country whose population is roughly a quarter muslim and most of the rest are ethnically slavic  who have called themselves yugoslavians  serbians  and bulgarians in the last hundred years  amounts to roughly helping the taliban blow up buddhist statues for political ends  because of political nature of the article i would advise a complete rewrite by people will credentials in ancient studies  history is not a popularity contest  just stick to the facts as we know them what s ironic is that virtually every last piece of evidence that macedon wasn t greek  is either  trans lated from greek or comes from greek artifacts  the citizens of fyrom can t even read inscriptions from macedon  as they are almost all writen in greek their own macedonian language was called bulgarian less than a hundred years ago  ,7a19399809cb657f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

21951,13915, dithering here  i m sorry we haven t met sooner there is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with his name is user tharkuncoll  an anglo saxonist english traditionalists  even the pro celtic  pro roman  are apparently the bane of the british isles here at wikipedia  but i don t know about that in real life  considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant yes  it s said to be more accepting than the proud teutonic approach to english identification  although it seems as though the celtofascists here are trying to spin the english alone as foreign to the isles  even though it is easy to discover the celtic origins in roman europe  especially the brythonic kind  as much as anglo saxon european ties are to the post classical rome of charlemagne and other holy roman germanics they think that pro celtic  pro roman means hostile cultural appropriation  as they have identified you as the other the big pink elephant in the room it is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile  mutual exclusionary factions of celt  roman and german  for most people involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another  but hardly any singular romanists  i m afraid perhaps i should try that imagine the double whammy of negativity from the celto germanicists ahh there s no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed  it seems incidentally  if you d like to get worked up elsewhere  go check out the archives of that talk page here  for instance in that article  it is apparently considered nonsense by  that the greeks bestowed the name british isles upon that set of islands off of gaul and that is the ultimate origin  as they instead focus exclusively upon the tudor stuart settlement  extreme violation of wp weight and barely even narrowly wp synth  so wrapped up in violations of wp nor which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect  nor do they care to see that roman britain was only that part of albion  that part of the bi in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by rome  even as erin would go free not contradicting the fact that they are both british w hate ver that originally meant aside from the trojan story just about any and all bi related pages are vicious black holes and often  the only way to go about it  is by using extreme caution and wisdom you will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish  their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you don t fit their profile  then you are wrong not just what you happen to do or write  it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works many times  after selecting a target  they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough  they will have provoked thee into becoming banned  just to see you squirm  as they do w hate ver it is they wish  to put the spin on this or that subject  according to their absolutist truisms of course  you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins won t even bother to level the playing field for you  only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery they will  most likely  base their complaints upon improper procedures which is orwellian codespeak for we don t like what he stands for  let s overwhelm him in numbers all said  it is very nice to meet you you  like me  with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving  would probably enjoy this a lot i ve been a fan for the longest time  of you  tharkuncoll  ,24ba70c5e58074b4,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

7511,103770,  lol  gee  i wish you were part of wp canada i ve tried to raise the issue of their irrelevance before but got shot down  rather patronizingly too they re supposed to be parallel to people from whatcom county or people from oxfordshire but the reality is that regional districts are not anything like counties are  especially not in terms of any self referential this is where i m from sense unless you mean all people from x categories in the case of regional districts  which have only existed since and also do not include indian reserves in their governance  and have extremely limited powers  sewer  zoning  some planning and disaster management they re not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with indian reserves or people from them  some users  like user backspace  and i  got into something like edit wars over his her labelling objects like mountains  lakes  etc with them  and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way  different branch of the governance system  namely ministry of environment there s also  y see  forest districts and forest regions  land districts  which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind ministry of environment regions  for parks theoretically but bc parks  has its own system within moe health regions  hospitals  etc school districts  counties which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life development regions  which are relevant to daily life and provincially kept statistics  though tey re formed from aglloomerations boundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively and bc tourism  http w hellobc com  has its own system of regions the rationale provided by the regional district categories defenders is that because it s the system that statscan uses to divvy up bc for the census  i e  counting people  then it makes sense to use them as geographic subdivisions for where people are from but it just doesn t make sense the problem now is that there s all kinds of mirrored wiki clones which ahve statments like x mountain is a mountain in the such and so regional district though the more relevant reference is in the such and so mountain range or in the x country valley in bc there s lots of historical region references of the nicola country shuswap country omineca country type  sometimes capitalized  though often not  and often just the shuswap the okanagan the omineca etc  and regional district names  and also electoral district names  are often built out of them e g  columbia shuswap  okanagan similkameen  but i ve also seen  trans lated categories articles saying fraser valley when meaning the fraser valley regional district  the problem is that only half of the fraser valley is even in the regional district of that name  the rest is in the greater vancouver one and similarly the cariboo regional district doesn t include all of the cariboo  and itself includes a region known as the chilcotin i ve created categories for most of those areas  and a parallel hierachy for same  but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries can t be cited easily  even though they re what people actually use and historically pre date even the province itself there s some subcategories using that format e g  category people from the similkameen  where the similkameen the similkameen country and also category cariboo people  although that s largely intended for historical figures from that region s glory days during the cariboo gold rush and since in the way british columbians actually talk  so and so is from the thompson nicola regional district would mean that that person works for the thompson nicola regional district most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person myself  i d like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that  the rationale is that some other long ago wikipedian created the hierarchy and so we should respect that even though that person  to me  was utterly clueless and shouldn t have created them at all the only thing the main rd categories should be used for is the component municipalities  though there are some electoral areas that have articles  but ti s when those start getting used as geographic descriptors  it s entirely offbase  it s all over googlemaps and wikimaps  too  and it s really annoying to see  similarly the use of the french form of indian reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hell s half digital acreage because it s what statscan  wrongly  uses as if statscan were the only classification system and as if real people talked like bureaucrats in ottawa do anyway sorry for the rant  it s been rare for me to find,2b2daaab747c1b88,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

115692,13091,ok  sorry for the delay in responding properly from what i can tell  the bare facts of the matter are that you made edits to a number of lds related articles  and those edits were reverted by various editors  myself included now  there are two main ways of viewing these facts  one  that your edits were consistent with wikipedia policy and the editors who reverted them were not justified in doing so  two  that your edits were not consistent with wikipedia policy and the other editors were justified in reverting them this is why i asked you about your understanding of wikipedia policy  you are relatively new here  and despite your confidence that your edits were appropriate  my view of them was that they violated several policies and guidelines  it s natural for newcomers to take some time learning the ropes  so it doesn t imply any malice on your part  since the heart of the conflict seems to be how you and i regard your edits in light of wp policy  it seems best to isolate the points of policy where our understanding differs  in hopes that we can establish areas of common ground from which we can work out other differences  or at least agree about what we irreconcilably disagree it would be helpful  though  to know that you ve indeed read the pertinent policies  so that we can speak with the same lingo and refer to the same general ideas have you done this thanks  talk ,22aa18c65ff3f521,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

33164,45978, jehovah s witnesses related question hi jeffro i don t remember ever actually writing any wikipedia comments before  so forgive me if my formatting ends up wonky  i was just looking for lists of watchtower publications to help me with my collection  when i stumbled across this page and section https en wikipedia org wiki list of watch tower society publications primary study aids  https en wikipedia org wiki talk list of watch tower society publications study aids  the heading these publications are intended to convert interested individuals struck me as a bit jarring and out of place  for one  the immediate next header is secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism so it is not even consistent  secondly  i am not sure that i agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header  as it includes original research  private interpretation of primary sources  and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed  e g how does a s kingdom ministry support the statement that studies in the scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals thirdly and lastly  making statements about intent is always notoriously difficult and subject to conflicting interpretation  while making statements of fact is much simpler and should be preferred  with that in mind  a possible alternative header might be something like these publications are generally considered prior to baptism it is concise  clear  consistent with the other headers and doesn t make assumptions about intent  only fact  may i have your thoughts you have previously commented at wikipedia talk pages  and you had mastered wiki formatting such as indenting at the time  you also referred to yourself in the third person a few times  i hope you ve recovered from that oddity the intended purpose of the  bible study  program offered by jehovah s witnesses most definitely is to convert individuals to the jw faith  though the students are not told of that goal at the outset of the study  for example your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth  qualify as an unbaptized publisher  and become a dedicated and baptized witness of jehovah our kingdom ministry  april page chapter of what does the bible really teach pages your alternative wording would therefore be misleading  because the students don t start out with any intention of being baptised as members of the religion they just think they re  learning more about the bible your wording would only be suitable if the order of events was a  a person wants to be baptised as a jw  b  they study the necessary literature  c  they get baptised  i have added references to the article supporting the fact that the publications are used with the goal of converting individuals  pediainsight can you supply diffs of plagiarism copyvios  if that is genuinely what the user is doing then i have this shiny banhammer in my tool belt  guy for a few examples previously indicated  see user talk pediainsight citations  more recently  his edits at homeopathy plagiarised an extract of dana ullman s book  if you d like other specific examples  please advise which ones  line breaks thanks for your contributions to the tonga adventist article  a minor point  you have been removing line breaks from the end of sentences  see wikipedia manual of style accessibility text  do not insert line breaks within a sentence  since this makes it harder to edit with a screen reader  a single line break may f,7adcdccc646a0269,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

3853,115893,  here is the explanation of the legal side of capital maintenance as quoted directly from the capital maintenance concept and share repurchases in south african law by f h i cassim and rehana cassim  the capital maintenance concept the south african companies act of adopts a strange and a curios ambivalence towards the nineteenth century common law concept of the maintenance of the share capital of a company  in some respects  the companies act still clings to this archaic and outdated concept  while in other respects  it boldly sweeps away the concept and replaces it with the more modern twins tests of liquidity and solvency as a form of creditor protection according to the capital maintenance concept  the issued share capital of a company is seen as a guarantee fund or a permanent fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of a company  with the result that the issued share capital of a company may not be reduced  nor may it be returned to shareholders except where the companies act or the common law authorizes it  thus  lord halsbury  l c in the ooregum gold mining company of india ltd v roper declared that t he capital is fixed and certain  and every creditor of the company is entitled to look to that capital as his security this was echoed some eight decades later in cohen no v segal where the court  in prohibiting the payment of a dividend out of share capital  proclaimed that w  hate ver has been paid by a member cannot be returned to him and no part of the corpus of the company can be returned to a member so as to take away from the fund to which the creditors have a right to look as that out of which they are to be paid  the capital may be spent or lost in carrying on the business of the company  but it cannot be reduced except in the manner and with the safeguards provided by the statute  in accordance with this concept  ss and of the companies act prohibit a company from issuing its shares at a discount unless certain stringent precautions have been complied with  section prohibits a company from paying interest on shares out of share capital unless this is authorised by the articles of association of the company or by a special resolution  the interest paid is restricted to a maximum of six per cent per annum  and the approval of the minister of industries  commerce and tourism has been obtained  f h i cassim ll b cum laude ll m  um laude university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa  advocate of the high court of south africa  associate professor of law  university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa  consultant with bowman gilfillan inc  rehana cassim ba  cum laude ll b cum laude university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa bowman gilfillan inc these statutory provisions find their roots in the capital maintenance concept  but it no longer makes any sense to preserve them in their present form  because instead of complying with the burdensome requirements of s a company may now simply make a payment including dividend payments in terms of s as amended in whether out of capital or profits  to its shareholders provided that this is authorised by its articles of association and that it satisfies the tests of liquidity and solvency as explained below a company may  if it so desires  prohibit in its articles of association such payments section abandons the common law concept of capital maintenance and together with it the fundamental common law principle that dividends may only be paid out of distributable profits  unlike english law  ss and which regulated reductions of share capital have been repealed by s of the companies amendment act of with the result that there is no longer any statutory procedure for the reduction of a company s share capital  expect in accordance with s of the companies act  perhaps this conflict in the underlying philosophy and policy of the south african companies act is a direct result of the patchwork and piecemeal reform that has taken place in south african corporate law during the year existence of the companies act of by way of contrast  ss of the uk companies act have preserved the statutory procedures and regulations relating to reductions of share capital  share repurchases another vital aspect of the reform of the capital maintenance concept is the right conferred by s of the companies act  as amended by s of the companies amendment act of to enable companies to purchase their own shares  until south african corporate law was one of the few remaining common law jurisdictions which continued to pr,6bacb00b493f82a5,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

21514,42383, definition  tabin this proposal  i will discuss why the wikipedia definition for probability  is not a good  valid definition  and needs to be changed  probability is something that is used every day  it is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain  however  in order to further our knowledge of probability  we must truly understand the definition of the word first  according to wikipedia  there is not a clear  valid definition for probability  and i propose to change this user nparibello njitwill summer probability  tabthe given wikipedia definition is as follows  probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain the proposition of interest is usually of the form will a specific event occur the attitude of mind is of the form how certain are we that the event will occur the certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number  between and we call probability the higher the probability of an event  the more certain we are that the event will occur  thus  probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a  random event will occur the opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is  it begins with  probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain  the word ordinarily is not only ambiguous  but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about  aside from the ambiguity  the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well  although i am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree  but also on my own to further my knowledge  i still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant  i would not consider probability an attitude of mind  because this simply does not make sense  the proposition of interest and attitude of mind are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability  probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event tabthe given wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is  rather than defining it  it states that  the proposition of interest is usually of the form this is not only an example instead of a definition  but it is an extremely poor example  the word usually is very vague  leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time  the definition also ends with probability in an applied sense  but what does that really mean  because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to  this makes the definition unclear  tabthe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between and for anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense  this definition most likely makes little sense  the way it is written is very vague  but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from the event will definitely not occur to the event will definitely occur these ranges are also often written in percent form to i believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages  the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid  the range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome  while this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability  i would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense  even though definitions should not include examples  for example  the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is or this is because there are two possible outcomes  heads or tails  and both are equally likely  if the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides  the probability of landing heads would be or since there are no other possible outcomes  as stated in the original definition  the higher the probability of an event  the more certain we are that the event will occur  tabtwo good quality sources comes from richard l  sheaffer in his book  introduction to probability and its applications  and glenn shaffer in his book probability and finance  both sheaffer and shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges  including njit  both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability  making them two of the best sources for this proposal  from a mathematical standpoint  richard sheaffer states that probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number p a  to every event a so that the following axioms hold  p a and p s glenn shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy  les,71139ef5b18eb352,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

47848,21196, team roster moved from user talk kevin mce  hi there  i wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited wp crystal  i m not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate  thanks  i don t know what needs to be explained we cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year  because we do not know the future an encyclopaedia reports facts  not expectations  hi again  firstly  i moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow  i am still not clear exactly what at wp crystal makes this content inappropriate  this is not a predicted team roster  it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of team sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for and then that not happening must be very slim  it is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year  that is in the preceding paragraph and i would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that a roster  not a word that should be used on an article about a uk subject  but that is a different matter  is not something that exists in and even as a speculative list  it is so incomplete as to be meaningless  it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles  but these are not the point returning to the crystal balling issue  you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim  you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility  and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact let s hope it doesn t happen  but sky might go bust  or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury  before january  in which case will arrive  they will not be part of the team  and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error facts  not expectation  i will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in doesn t mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in and that the team might not even exist  however  all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in that makes them part of the squad for we re not simply expecting them to be  they are confirmed to be  surely though  we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen  i think you are misinterpreting wp crystal  i d suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable  as is the case here  if it turns out that any or all of these riders don t ride for team sky in then the wikipedia article won t have been guilty of having recorded an error because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available  i m not saying that it won t happen  nor that it is not very likely  but that it is expectation  not fact you speak of verifiability  but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable if they were to die before the end of this year  they will not be in the team  the future is not confirmed an entirely accurate description of something that does not currently exist is not possible  and as a description  a man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate i find your position on this matter a little strange  you seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so  seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change  the names that are being announced are for the squad  so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such  we can  and should  only base the article on what can be verified at the current time  and that is that the riders named are part of the team for the information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in and our article is  and should  only ever be based upon information available at the time  i would note that  not only has another user reverted the change you made which i am concerned about here  but also that a further ten names have been announced,37e9d340151a8d1f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

45997,150900, someone keeps erasing this with no comment to me very unethical  minutes after posting this it was erased  check it out  this is very suspicious and unethical by the parties involved  senior management  if in existence  asked to investigate please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article  hello  my name is johnhistory  i was recently  block  for my mentioning of major problems here because i did not assume good faith when confronted with bad faith  i believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the jimbo guidelines to the t  i am going to post what i wrote on my talk page after being  block  during the controversy here  i could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the wiki elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny  this surely does not make me popular amongst them  yet i must assume good faith in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process  i was accused of supporting things i never did  all i ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents  that is all  i don t especially care about rev wright  etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then i will stick my neck out for it  i have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased  that is what struck me about the discussion page mind you i never made an edit on the actual article i was banned for merely talking on a talk page  it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group  think environment  thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public controlled by a small group of ideologues wikipedia  these political minding ideologues are dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions  these  not just mine  are non threatening non  offensive language just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be  block  and potentially banned for not assuming good faith or positively contributing to the consensus what if the consensus is wrong then  what if about if you have already assumed good faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it  the evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing obama with w bush  additionally  the obama administration through proxies  in my strong opinion  is at work in the obama article  i say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion  as is understandable  that someone out of the thousands of obama connected likely people is not involved on the barack obama page  it is the most visited page on wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name barack obama  however  that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes  the number of those is in the millions  that is why jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a real encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work  the language given the rulers of wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with  often the language is contradictory  for instance i was  block  for my comments on the talk page and cited for making a point instead of wanting to edit how  exactly  do you make a talk page based discussion about edits without making a point  another monitor told me i had to assume good faith  yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article  in addition  the talk page says no writing will be allowed that involves general discussion however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts  additionally  the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the president of the united stat,73de058fa17673a5,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

21926,53965, disputing job guarantee section chartalists don t guarantee a job they merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation  since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss it s quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn t employed  in fact  it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses if you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss  and it s due to a demand problem  it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization if the private sector is attempting to build assets  run a surplus  and you have an external deficit  the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit  that is  the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector so the section i ve marked for expert review needs to recognize that chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job  but by hiring more and or spending i e  buying more from the private sector things could easily  and likely would  weigh more towards the second option  posting on behalf of one filburt  ,9031e975115d54b6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

138268,114050,the following policy is given in wikipedia verifiability articles should rely on reliable  third party published sources with a reputation for fact checking and accuracy on the other hand wikipedia no original research states examples of primary sources include original philosophical works  and any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation it also states at the end of the paragraph appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue  and these are general rules  the decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment  and should be discussed on article talk pages  the above enables me to derive some conclusions what is mend by third party sources wp v  is not exactly the same as tertiary sources nor if the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other  which probably is not the case  i think third party sources are  placed in context  other sources than wikipedia itself and its editors this would make sense  given what follows directly after the line containing third party sources reliable sources are necessary to substantiate material within articles  vassyana said reliance on rand directly is a npov concern  it is now clear that it is of no concern at all  yes an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required  she also said there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material which is still argued  in contrast i say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material  the arguments pro primary source material have  as of yet  not been given a response  the focus was on the demand to have  mainly  third party sources  in the proper context primary sources are third party sources  fulfilling the demand  again the decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment  and should be discussed on article talk pages  let s now focus on that ,621ae2ebde4fb5dc,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

30718,30462, i would like to strongly advise against deletion of this article on the argument that phylogenetics is not equal to  nor even synonymous to  cladistics  the difference between them is actually abyssal  phylogenetics is a scientific discipline resting on the fundamental principle of objectivity  whereas cladistics instead is the opposite  resting on the principle of subjectivity  phylogenetics partitions reality into categories  i e  concepts  and discusses reality in terms of these categories  whereas cladistics instead assumes that categories  concepts  exist and confuses them  what phylogenetics discerns does cladistics confuse  in line with this approach  cladistics also strives hard to confuse itself  as a concept  with  the concept  phylogenetics and with  the concept  science  my empirical support for these allegations is that cladistics confuses time and space  thereby denying that time can be relative to space  which is contradicted by the fact that time is relative to space  see envall  biol  j  linn  soc cladistics denies the kind of thing it calls paraphyletic groups  which actually is a disguised denial of the fundament for science  that is  objectivity deletion of this article would thus be devastating for phylogenetics  and in continuation  for encyclopedias  which tries to keep concepts apart  and maybe also for science itself  instead  the article ought to be cleaned from cladistic influence  there is still a big part of phylogenetics that is  practically  free from cladistic influence  i e that which develops probability inferences of phylogeny  and still does the consistent conceptualization of phylogenies  that is  the linnean system  occupy a central position in phylogenetics  a clensing of the article does  however  appear impossible in an open forum like this  since nothing can hinder cladists from incorporating their confusion in the article  whereas they can hinder a resolution of the confusion  the power over the content in articles is in practice related to number of proponents of certain comprehensions  rather than to knowledge about them or understanding of them  one can easily envision how wikipedia would have appeared if it had been made of germans during the nd world war nazi sm would certainly not have been described in condescending terms  this is a fundamental problem for wikipedia that needs to be addressed for wikipedia to retain reliability  a basic requirement ought to be that its editors have at least some  scientific  education  there has to be some captain s  on the ship  and they have to have some  scientific  education  otherwise  wikipedia will gradually disintegrate into a mess if wikipedia finds no other phylogeneticist that can  and wants to  clean up the article  i am prepared to do it  it does  however  require that i am given the power to include and exclude contributions to the best of my judgement and knowledge  my neutrality has been questioned in connection with my earlier contributions to wikipedia  but as i have tried to explain  i consider a scientific approach  i e objectivity  to be neutral  the problem with cladistics is that it is subjective and denies objectivity  since it leaves no neutral position between it and objectivity  there is no neutral position between a denial of a comprehension and that comprehension  i instead counter the denial by falsifying it with empirical evidence  this does not counter deny cladistics  but only shows that cladistics does not agree with facts  whereas objectivity  i e science  does  i thus show that cladistics denial of science does not agree with facts  this conclusion is not neutral  but it is as neutral  or objective  as anything possibly can be  questioning of this view on neutrality has to require an explanation of what else neutrality possibly can be  for me  neutrality is equal to objectivity some claim that objectivity is impossible  but i claim that it is not  this is  however  another story i thus advise against a deletion of the article and announce myself as willing to clean the article from cladistic influence  on the condition that i m given certain authorities mats envall  presently at ,50da4643ddf40e9d,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

24412,41218, forbes magazine s most powerful ranking there is an increasing number of forbes magazine references appearing in the leading paragraphs of biographical wiki pages the opening paragraphs of a wiki page should contain important details  not subjective trivia forbes  most powerful  ranking is merely one american magazine editor s perceived and unsupported opinion as to each well known person s  power by rights it should not appear on any wiki page other than the forbes magazine page or forbes magazine ranking page  it appears the less powerful an important person or celebrity is  the more likely  s he is to have a forbes ranking on their wiki page truly powerful people do not for example  barack obama  president  usa no mention of forbes ridiculous ranking on his page vladimir putin  prime minister  russia no mention of forbes dmitry medvedev  president  russia no mention of forbes david cameron  prime minister  united kingdom no mention of forbes benjamin netanyahu  prime minister  israel no mention of forbes abdullah bin abdulaziz al saud  king  saudi arabia no mention of forbes nicolas sarkozy  president  france no mention of forbes ali khamenei  supreme leader  iran no mention of forbes naoto kan  prime minister  japan no mention of forbes ashfaq parvez kayani  chief of army staff  pakistan no mention of forbes so why do the forbes rankings keep appearing all over wiki is there a wiki rule to stop the magazine from obtaining free advertising at wiki s expense sorry but what does this have to do with the main page also while i have no opinion on whether forbes ratings belong it hardly seems surprising that the less  powerful  and important person or celebrity is  the more likely they are to have a forbes rating  you don t need a forbes rating to tell you barack obama is important  you just need to words president of the united states the same with all the rest you mentioned  why do forbes magazine s unsubstantiated rankings garner support on wiki they are obviously fabricated many are rubbish for example  forbes rank michelle obama as the most powerful woman in the world yet it is barack who is the president  not michelle as  first lady  michelle has no power whatsoever  how about the number ranked  woman it is an american food saleswoman  irene rosenfeld what complete baloney number is an american television host  oprah winfrey and finally at number is a woman with real power  the chancellor of germany  angela merkel forbes incredibly has ranked an american grocer and an american television host above a head of government  my question is  why does a supposedly factual encyclopaedia  wiki  rate worthy of mention the suppositions and meanderings of a magazine that specialises in listening to gossip rather than in researching facts so what does this have to do with the main page  if you don t think the information belongs in articles the place to discuss that is on the talk page of the effected articles you could also be bold and remove it and explain why if another editor reverts you then you are into the bold  revert  discuss cycle and you know who to discuss it with  the discussion does not belong here because it has nothing to do with the main page and that is what this page is for  fan and if you do want discussion somewhere in a more centralised page  the big header has suggestions  perhaps start at wp vpp ,6df8574912f747d2,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

24071,116790, first  i d like to thank you for discussing this issue with me you could just have told me to take a hike or something anyway  let s take a look at image esquire jennifer connelly jpg  the jennifer connelly picture that i tagged today the image was moved to the infobox this morning which means that it was not being used according to the license it was instead being used specifically to depict connelly  not in context of discussing that particular issue of the magazine that s why i tagged that image with the image moved back to the paragraph concerning the issue of the magazine  a compelling argument could be made that the image is now being used in accord with the license this seems to be the consensus of the people on the discussion page as well  though the discussion just started so  whether or not this image is fair use depends on how it is used in the article i am much happier if this is spelled out in a rationale on the image page that the license specifically states that a detailed fair use rationale should be added seems  to me  to support this contention in this case  the rationale would be simple  something along the lines of  used to depict issue of magazine in question in paragraph which discusses this issue  not solely to depict connelly  now  i previously mentioned that the image description page specifically mentions that the dvdcover requires a detailed rationale in many cases  the fair use case is obvious it s a dvd cover used to illustrate the particular dvd in question but the image description page and the license text both still indicate that the rationale is required also  what often ends up happening is that the dvd image then gets used to depict something outside of the license a dvd of a movie starring connelly  for example  used solely to illustrate what connelly looks like  now  i ve been using the fair use disputed tag for quite some time but recently  people have been correcting that to the missing rationale tag  so i just started using that this has the added advantage of requiring that the issue be resolved in short order and providing a simple copy and paste official warning template which can be used  and is specifically designed  to warn the person who uploaded the image  i am concerned that a great number of images on wikipedia are used in blatant violation of copyright this is clear and i doubt anyone would debate it as a result  i personally do request that people who upload copyrighted images provide an accurate source  an accurate license  and a detailed fair use rationale in all honesty  i m quite happy with any reasonable attempt at a fair use rationale and accept many that i believe fall far short of what wikipedia officially requests i believe it is important to deal with images without sufficient information because continuing to accept images which may violate copyright put us at direct risk it may be obvious to the uploader why an image is fair use but we may not be able to contact the uploader when we are sued and as i mentioned before  i believe both the license and image description help page specifically require this  now that i have stated my point and you have stated your point  there s a very good chance that we aren t going to agree i m happy to request additional help  perhaps from the admin noticeboard policies page  if you think this would be productive  jennifer connelly there is a discussion of the fair use assertment of an image going on for this page your comments on the talk page would be much appreciated  note this message has been sent to all recent registered editors of the article  less vandal fighters talk reversions  hey  every place i ve contributed  everything reverted  i spent a lot of time making contributions and you went and reverted everything  a whole bunch of stuff  it looks like you may have just pressed an undo button of everything i did because there s no basis of reverting it  this stuff i m looking at is not vandalism at all  without getting all the information to figure out if i was a sockpuppet  you not only  block  me but reverted all of my edits to  i can t even go back and change it because i would be changing a lot of work other writers have done here at wikipedia too  and it would be like doing what you did to me  to others  no offense or anything  but a good administrator looks into a situation without taking sides  i ve basically wasted a lot of time here because of all the reversions on top of being accused of bei,704c0950c51b67a3,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

34280,137453, let me clarify my position  while it may be a debatable point whether an amazon review or a blog thread is a reliable source to use at wikipedia  i personally think it is given a supporting piece of evidence  e g  calling the person herself or the owner of the blog personally you are completely wrong if you think she is actually not a dissident or that the review and blog postings attributed to her are not hers um  tara can you double check with pz that that post was actually from her  look at the wording syntax thats not how scientists write  that looks like lincoln with gel in his hair pz s not raised any red flags  and the second quote was from the live chat  the visit was to promote this new venture of hers  unfortunately  i have no doubt it s her posted by  tara c  smith march pm  yeah  i ll confirm it  that was lynn margulis on the site and in the chatroom posted by  pz myers march pm  that sigh was because i thought highly of margulis  she has done some excellent work  and is always a source for original ideas  unfortunately  the hiv denialist comments were all ignorant crap that only a deluded fool would find convincing  so that was a sigh of disappointment posted by  pz myers march am  furthermore  i know form personal communication with harvey bialy that lynn margulis did communicate to him personally her positive review of the book  so  while the question of what s a reliable source may be some issue  i just want you to know if happen to have any doubts  that you are completely factually wrong if you claim  a  her statements and viewpoints attributed to her are not hers  and  b  she is not a dissident  unless you really believe that a mainstream biology professor is  without any motivation  committing some kind of hoax  or is himself being impersonated by someone  that s what i was referring to when i said you were beyond hopeless ,df7e60573260c845,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

5187,85373,  i know allegations of admin abuse require clear proof  but it may be below  see  i wouldn t mind so much if i knew what bad behavior i was doing  i have in good faith begged and pleaded for anyone  anyone with expertise or experience to explain what was blockable  please take the time to review considerately  at virtually every turn  when i requested a policy clarification as a month user  if i even got a cite  it was only to a whole policy page  and never with a diff to my alleged offense  this behavior is so consistent from so many users that it is hard to explain  much less to provide sources for this possibly exceptional claim  but let s please start with what points i do get  and the questions i need answered first by you  the reviewer n b  i wrote this the first hour of block  i trustingly clicked save and did not realize that there would be an edit conflict due to the edit warrior  below  closely following me and stating her block agreement sadly huh and giving nuanced advice and compliments  unhelpful this minor frustration can be gotten past  but of course this request is now many hours late  please at least quickly indicate willingness to answer see whole discussion  as near as i can tell  wp point is intended to refer to my politely proposing a change to wp v  my first policy suggestion  and disclosing what i regarded as an edit war about the issue  instead of any comments on the merits  except one positive one i received consistent criticism about my poor formatting followed by refusal to address the merits because  apparently  it was obviously unnecessary to answer  q  when one has made a policy suggestion in good faith and one receives zero discussion on its negatives and significant negative discussion on one s person and presentation  is one refusing to get the point if one continues politely requesting the specific demerits of the proposal that would indicate nonconsensus on its merits  see whole user discussion  as near as i can tell  wp har  first i ve heard of this charge against me  is intended to refer to my appropriate level user warnings in response to an editor using obscenity and assuming bad faith this is only the most reasonable guess  of course  after he stated he was entitled to assume bad faith  he changed up and claimed facetiously he really was assuming good faith  my links there indicate specifically what behavior i referred to  i know of no other case which might come near to harassment  q  when one uses edit warnings in full compliance with policy and is met with continuing bad faith  is one harassing  see whole coi discussion  as near as i can tell  wp de is intended to refer primarily to my first extended correction of a user charging me with coi  along with a suggestion that the accusing user may also have coi  certainly i might have been overstrong in that edit  i recognize not noticing the word limit  but i adverted that myself but again  there was no indication of why a donor to a political candidate has the sort of close relationship envisioned by coi  there was one attempt at googling me  and i m not looking up the personal details policy right now  which turned up nothing undisclosed besides my blog comments but this was described as considerable involvement of promotional activities recall there are about ron paul meetup volunteers  and nearly that many donors  if i worked for a member workplace there might be a bit more point  but even that would be debatable in good faith  q  is every political donor or meetup member forbidden from editing candidate related articles neutrally  or only those who willingly disclose the relationship  as near as i can tell  there is a further potential application of wp point  which by the way is an application of the rule  convenient to the generic  that a generic warning is fungible with any warning apparently i don t realize that  in some sense  these users are every one justified in refusing to explain specifically any of their adverse actions against me  and that i am being disruptively pointed if i explain specific charges against them  citing policy and diffs  and there i do admit not understanding  the policies are no procrustean bed  but very specific  i am completely unfamiliar with operating in such an environment other than to do one s best to wp agf  to complain properly and carefully  and to accept potential suffering for it  however i m essentially barred by generic threats  yes  from complaining specifically  and i m completely certain that a generic  unsourced complaint from me  as appears to be the,e45ba431e537b85a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

1758,79070,  chalk one up for ed robert merkel  perhaps it would make sense to move some of the stuff from terrorism against arabs back here  if we came to having distinct articles once again  for instance  lord moyne was not much of an arab  though they were his favorites  i guess so his assassination by stern gang belongs more to israeli terrorism uriyan facts about israel  note that many of the statements on this page are disputed with all the due respect  i don t think this link should be applied on this page  for several reasons it is not about israeli terrorism  but about general israel bashing  it contains mostly incomplete and partial information  for instance  the green palestinian number plates was something they asked for  israeli arabs have regular yellow plates  and because of that are sometimes targeted by palestinian gunmen many of these statements deserve a proper discussion  in wikipedia  not out of it uriyan  the uss liberty incident is generally thought to have been an israeli mistake  the uss liberty was a us navy ship  it was flying a navy ensign  it had guns on it  since it wasn t civilian  engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism  and has no place on this page  which is about terrorism  uriyan uriyan  this sentence has been removed from the article about kach  they have also organized murders and beatings of palestinians in the u s  really who i too am curious about this claim  it is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article  can someone provide specific claims  and a few sources for us to check out  also  i do not understand what this has to do with the government of israel  i agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right wing american jew s to carry out such a thing  but  a  there is only a vague allegation being made  and  b  this has nothing to do with the israeli government  nor the pre israel proto state in the british mandate of palestine  we can t simply lump all crimes done by jew ish people into the category of israeli terrorism all crimes committed by arabs considered palestinian terrorism  no unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of israel  why are they listed as israeli terrorism instead of jew ish terrorism i d tend to agree with zoe here about the title of the article being wrong  since it s so controversial coming up with a universally acceptable definition of terrorist vs  freedom fighter maybe we should just have violence against israelis and violence against palestinians pages  or some such such pages exist  at least for palestinians but nobody bothers to update them  it s much less  sex  than israeli terrorism then maybe this should redirect to violence against palestinians after moving the content of this page its talk there  of course the page i had in mind was palestinians killed by israelis  but i support leaving x terrorism pages  because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre calculated killing  which is terrorism  actually  i was thinking of very neutral titles  such as the violence ones above chucking in all the text from any non npov titled articles scattered about  they can be smoothed out later  and redirecting to the neutral titled articles  it should make npov easier to maintain  i d lose the terrorism pages entirely in the process  dumping their text talk into the new articles as we re never going to agree on which acts are terrorism and which are not  and you know we re not  yeah if the articles just give the facts then we can leave terrorism or not decisions up to the readers  having considered the concept  i support it  in the text itself  we would then have the freedom to describe which actions exactly can be considered terrorism and by whom  bloody hell  did we just agree on something  uri  will wonders never cease yes  we did agree  and i m glad at it  i hope it ll be a good beginning for tomorrow i ve got to log out now  changed this qibya operation  carried out among others by unit under the command of ariel sharon is often classified as terrorism  it lead to the death of almost civilians  others claim it was not terrorism but a tragic incident during a period of bitter border warfare betw,d39fe86bcc88a9a8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

135918,12915,thanks i ll edit from the beginning of next month  no harm in dropping a reply to your note  since writing here is hardly editing wiki  were michael s mind open to rational persuasion  he would have yielded on this long before  his objection is  at this point  ideological  more examples will not convince him that we all get things wrong at times is easy to see  what is more difficult to understand is why we get things wrong  and why we persist in error on the israeli jew ish side of this common problem  there are two elements  one cultural  one a matter of the politics of image forging to win a global consensus by affecting the way events and history are perceived  i think michael s error is to be classified in the former  which is basically rooted in a long tradition of thinking in terms of jew ish exceptionalism  and therefore any analogies that may arise from the kind of descriptive language used to characterise palestinian realities that might remind one of similar jew ish realities  is repressed  michael dislikes  uprising  because there is the possibility that it might create a subliminal nexus with the warsaw uprising  there is a deeper analogy  the romans crushed bar kochba s revolt  which in the historical literature is often described as an  uprising and under hadrian set out to romanize judea  the creation of israel vindicates bar kochba  but also  in rejudaising palestine  creates an implicit structural analogy between the fanatic resistance of bar kochba  and the plo hamas the al aqsa type violence  esp sacred violence in the name of national restoration  this analogy is naturally repugnant to a cast of mind rooted in the myths of jew ish exceptionalism  since those who evoke the myth of masada must at the same time war down a native people who are battling from the redoubts of their rocky bantustans against the judaisation of their native and sacred territory  very much as bar kochba himself did  rabbinical schools after the failure of bar kochba developed a doctrine of submission to foreign states  one which lasted until the creation of israel redeemed the earlier foundational myths of the book of joshua  and dispelled cringing by recurring to the heroic militancy of the first invasion of canaan  ironically  what is expected of palestinians is that they cringe before the power of israel s occupation  any phenomenon bearing a generic resemblance to the sicarii  or zealotism  is dismissed as an appalling  arab cultural trait though in fact it resonates  mutatis mutandis  with analogies from jew ish history under the roman empire from titus to hadrian  where militant fanaticism and zealotism in the name of national autonomy flourished  the early zionists from jabotinsky to ben gurion to moshe dayan and menachem begin were perfectly aware that their policies bore these ironic resonances being thorough realists  they didn t have to kid themselves  today we live in the fog of public opinion myths  where these ironical analogies are elided from consciousness  people are raised on the standard clich  s  endlessly recycled by hasbara machines  and underwrite them sincerely  because they no longer have much of a sense of history  much could be said of this  but this is not the place regards,2235b7dae3ec7b76,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

54741,124209, werner s  trans formation thanks for the feedback the section titled the era of the est training says  he  werner  started to see the world as perfect the way it is and reported an insight that his attempts to change or modify either his physical circumstances or his mental outlook had their basis in a conception of the world  that it should differ from the way it is that precluded or at least limited one s experiential and creative appreciation of it this attempts to describe a pivotal evet in werner s life that he referrs to as a  trans formation  i felt that the description above fell way short of what it was that werner has said he experienced  i m not sure what the source of this material is  describing an experience like this is exceedingly difficult  seeing the world as perfect actually  i believe  was only a part of werner s experience of  trans formation  here is how werner described it in his own words in the film  trans formation  the life and legacy of werner erhard the way est happened was very simple  i had this  trans formational experience  i had a  trans formation  whoever i had been up until that point i no longer was  i was on my way to work and there was nothing significant about it but i was on the golden gate bridge  i just happened to be there and that s when i had the realization that what my life was about was really meaningless  it was empty  and this realization that the things that i thought were so significant like looking good and winning  just the normal things that most people think are important  that they really had no importance  that it was all empty and meaningless  when i broke through the sadness  broke through the sense of despair of having wasted my life  i all of a sudden realized my god  i m free  what s that mean to be free  free to choose  free to create a life that was worth living in order to describe it accurately why not quote werner directly  i did my best to capture his words exactly as he spoke them  is that considered a reliable source  given that it s a record of him speaking personally my purpose in posting this was to improve this section first for accuracy and second to elaborate in an event that was pivotal in his life  ,987455ccce06da8d,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

42263,119146, pseudoscience category i feel strongly that this article should be moved away from the pseudoscience category  as it does fulfill any of wikipedia s requirements of pseudoscience  wikipedia states other things usually should not be called pseudoscience on wikipedia alternative theoretical formulations  alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community  such as modified newtonian dynamics as opposed to dark matter  are not pseudoscience  but part of the scientific process  such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality  but  should they succeed in doing so  will usually be rapidly accepted  for instance  the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence  but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move  and thus such evidence was dismissed  when such a mechanism was discovered  it became mainstream as plate tectonics to determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation  consider this  alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science  or deal with strong  puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away  in an effort to create a model that better explains reality  pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs  but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes  pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence  such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection  though it may have a few papers with positive results  for example  parapsychology and homeopathy  aids denialists are not proposing a new form of science based on non scientific methods  they are merely disputing that the claims that other scientists make  and these disputes arise entirely from science  in fact  aids denialists claim that mainstream scientists are not using science correctly  in fact  all they are doing is asking for scientific proof of what the mainstream scientific community insists exists but can t verify  ,7ced5c8661a918b8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

29789,62820, i really think that you did a great job with this page  there is a large emphasis on application throughout the wiki which has its strengths given the audience  i do think that there are a fe sentence structure issues and some material that would be nice to add  you are the expert in this  stuff so please take my advice  with respect to the content  with a grain of salt introduction i like the points that you address  as far as versatility and challenges in design  one thing that i think needs a little work is the sentence structure  i noticed that the opening sentence is a hard to read  there is a lot of good stuff in it  but i think that it could be broken up a little bit  i think that the first sentence can be broken up into three different sentences addressing the purpose and challenges in application and decomposition  as it reads it is just a little hard to follow  also the term breakdown is used several times  and i was wondering if the term decomposition could be used interchangeably  overall i think that the intro hits all the areas that it should  and the content is good  i do think that it need a little restructuring though history i really found the history of these polymers to be interesting  i think your decision to make history a section was a good choice given the natural quality of a lot of these polymers  one thing that i did not like about the history section in the opening two sentences  i understand what you are trying to say  but i think there may be better ways to say that biodegradable polymers have a been around for a while  if you remove the two sentences i think it would be more fluid  i really like how you covered a large timespan  it is easy to get wrapped up in what is cutting edge  but i think you did a really good job covering as much time as possible and pointing out many things  nice  structure and properties this section was really nice  i really like the scheme that you have in the beginning  one nit picky thing i want to point out  is that think that there is a repeat in the first sentence of ester and ester bonds  also in the first sentence you mention that some of polymers  such as proteins  contain amide bonds i think a nice addition to the scheme next to biopolyesters would be biopolyamides and a following box labelled peptides  i notices that you mention it in the next section and it may be a good place to show it in your scheme  i really like the properties section of your article  you address a lot of challenges with respect to degradation another nit picky thing  i think the term impractical  in the third sentence could be changed to something more science like  synthesis this is section is great  i printed the article off to read it and as i was reading i thought they should really include a scheme for polyurethanes  and wah la  on the next page at the top there is a scheme for polyurethanes  so what i am trying to say is good placement  mechanism of breakdown another great section  one thing i think you both need to decide on is whether you are going to use the term breakdown  degradation  or decomposition  i see them all throughout  i am not sure which one is more right  but i think that you should agree on one and use it throughout  in the second paragraph there seems to be an error in your wiki language  there is the word oxygen that looks like this oxygen in the paragraph following your scheme  there is a sentence explaining the challenges for enzymes to evolve to accommodate the synthetic polymers  i there really like it and i think it is full of information  although  i think that this sentence is crucial  i also think that it could be worded better  in this same paragraph there is a sentence that starts with typically  after physical processes  there seems to be some extra words and the sentence does not quite make sense  applications  application section is really nice  i think that medicinal application for these is really interesting and i also think that most people will find this intriguing  i think your section is weighted toward medicinal applications  and i think that is awesome  now the stuff i thought that could be changed  i think that the first sentence of the second paragraph could be removed completely and the paragraph would be fine  in the third paragraph there is a sentence where you use the term in vitro twice  i think that second usage could be removed  also  i got a little confused in the example sentence about rat smooth muscle tissue  i really like the term holy grail not sure if this was intended to be a monty python reference  but it should of been  although  i like the term holy grail  i think from a professional stance there may be other terms you could use  pla  i think this s,a81112a675101e26,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

28791,49783, i had just typed out a smashing long post  then accidentally closed my browser tab so i will save the civility protests and long explanations for another day your proposed addition is mostly okay  and gives a good treatment to the question of how the word terrorist is applied to the organization i would add the fbi website  and the fact that it was one of the organizations on the fbi s terrorism task force watch list there are plenty of categories  too many probably  available to help direct readers interested in the topic of terrorism to this article category terrorism in america is one of them  the one you just added category organizations designated as terrorist by the u s  government  is another there is a huge blp concern with branding living ex members as terrorists  particularly unconvicted ones who deny the charge but again  this can all be handled by being cautious about what is said and how it is said why don t i give this a quick edit tomorrow  here on the talk page  and if neither you nor others object i ll throw in my approval and we ll add the new subsection to the article page that s okay by me as long as it s kept neutral  and neither the category nor the text authoritative give wikipedia s endorsement that they are terrorists  just that people have called them that ciao  ,851eb0a99b4a00f8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
