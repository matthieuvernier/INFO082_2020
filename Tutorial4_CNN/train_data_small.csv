51290,45663, this poorly written wiki article attempts to make it appear that ancient macedonians were distinct from ancient greeks  i would gambit the article is largely edited by people from fyrom republic of macedonia with irredentist aims towards greece  contrary to both us and un resolutions to refrain from propaganda against greek macedonians despite the occasional voice of objections there is no major dispute among most scholars that ancient macedon was inherently greek in nature at least more than anything else  the hellenic age  the greek word for what we in english call greek is evidence beyond dispute of this  to give an example of historical distortions found in this article  macedon or macedonia  greek makedon  a  was the name of a kingdom centered in the northern most part of ancient greece  bordered by the kingdom of epirus to the west and the region of thrace to the east  by saying the northern most part of greece it makes it seem like it bordered greece  there was no greece state in ancient times  there was only a collection of autonomous city states and kingdoms that self identified as greeks mycenae  athens  argos  ithica  sparta  macedon corinth  etc  another example of irredentism  the wiki article states  it became increasingly atticised during this period  though prominent athenians appear to have regarded the macedonians as uncouth this statement is very deceptive  it was common during times of conflict for greeks to label each other barbarians non greeks  as an insult similar to saying unamerican today while demosthenes used barbarians to describe macedonians  he also used it describe the athenean orator aristogeiton  aristophanes  nephelae line and even demosthenes himself as described by as a barbarian by aeschine  plato characterized the lesbian aeolic greek dialect as a barbarian register while addressing pittakos of mytilene  athenaios vi a  socrates calls strepsiadis strepsiadis was a well known athenian protagoras etc  etc  there are countless instances of greeks describing each other as barbarians  there are other examples of bias in the article but the most telling is how it lightly brushs over the hellenic period of macedon  similiar to the golden age of athens in which macedonia spread the greek language  greek culture  and greek ideas to the region  they unique flavour of macedon among greeks  was very similar to how athens also had unique aspects to it  as did sparta  as did most of the greek mini states  if macedon wasn t greek  then greek philosopher aristotle wasn t greek either  since he came from chalcidice in macedon to go down this road we would also need to rewrite a fair portion of wiki articles related to antiquity and the hellenistic period  to do this to suit the political needs of a country whose population is roughly a quarter muslim and most of the rest are ethnically slavic  who have called themselves yugoslavians  serbians  and bulgarians in the last hundred years  amounts to roughly helping the taliban blow up buddhist statues for political ends  because of political nature of the article i would advise a complete rewrite by people will credentials in ancient studies  history is not a popularity contest  just stick to the facts as we know them what s ironic is that virtually every last piece of evidence that macedon wasn t greek  is either  trans lated from greek or comes from greek artifacts  the citizens of fyrom can t even read inscriptions from macedon  as they are almost all writen in greek their own macedonian language was called bulgarian less than a hundred years ago  ,7a19399809cb657f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

21951,13915, dithering here  i m sorry we haven t met sooner there is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with his name is user tharkuncoll  an anglo saxonist english traditionalists  even the pro celtic  pro roman  are apparently the bane of the british isles here at wikipedia  but i don t know about that in real life  considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant yes  it s said to be more accepting than the proud teutonic approach to english identification  although it seems as though the celtofascists here are trying to spin the english alone as foreign to the isles  even though it is easy to discover the celtic origins in roman europe  especially the brythonic kind  as much as anglo saxon european ties are to the post classical rome of charlemagne and other holy roman germanics they think that pro celtic  pro roman means hostile cultural appropriation  as they have identified you as the other the big pink elephant in the room it is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile  mutual exclusionary factions of celt  roman and german  for most people involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another  but hardly any singular romanists  i m afraid perhaps i should try that imagine the double whammy of negativity from the celto germanicists ahh there s no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed  it seems incidentally  if you d like to get worked up elsewhere  go check out the archives of that talk page here  for instance in that article  it is apparently considered nonsense by  that the greeks bestowed the name british isles upon that set of islands off of gaul and that is the ultimate origin  as they instead focus exclusively upon the tudor stuart settlement  extreme violation of wp weight and barely even narrowly wp synth  so wrapped up in violations of wp nor which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect  nor do they care to see that roman britain was only that part of albion  that part of the bi in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by rome  even as erin would go free not contradicting the fact that they are both british w hate ver that originally meant aside from the trojan story just about any and all bi related pages are vicious black holes and often  the only way to go about it  is by using extreme caution and wisdom you will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish  their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you don t fit their profile  then you are wrong not just what you happen to do or write  it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works many times  after selecting a target  they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough  they will have provoked thee into becoming banned  just to see you squirm  as they do w hate ver it is they wish  to put the spin on this or that subject  according to their absolutist truisms of course  you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins won t even bother to level the playing field for you  only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery they will  most likely  base their complaints upon improper procedures which is orwellian codespeak for we don t like what he stands for  let s overwhelm him in numbers all said  it is very nice to meet you you  like me  with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving  would probably enjoy this a lot i ve been a fan for the longest time  of you  tharkuncoll  ,24ba70c5e58074b4,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

7511,103770,  lol  gee  i wish you were part of wp canada i ve tried to raise the issue of their irrelevance before but got shot down  rather patronizingly too they re supposed to be parallel to people from whatcom county or people from oxfordshire but the reality is that regional districts are not anything like counties are  especially not in terms of any self referential this is where i m from sense unless you mean all people from x categories in the case of regional districts  which have only existed since and also do not include indian reserves in their governance  and have extremely limited powers  sewer  zoning  some planning and disaster management they re not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with indian reserves or people from them  some users  like user backspace  and i  got into something like edit wars over his her labelling objects like mountains  lakes  etc with them  and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way  different branch of the governance system  namely ministry of environment there s also  y see  forest districts and forest regions  land districts  which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind ministry of environment regions  for parks theoretically but bc parks  has its own system within moe health regions  hospitals  etc school districts  counties which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life development regions  which are relevant to daily life and provincially kept statistics  though tey re formed from aglloomerations boundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively and bc tourism  http w hellobc com  has its own system of regions the rationale provided by the regional district categories defenders is that because it s the system that statscan uses to divvy up bc for the census  i e  counting people  then it makes sense to use them as geographic subdivisions for where people are from but it just doesn t make sense the problem now is that there s all kinds of mirrored wiki clones which ahve statments like x mountain is a mountain in the such and so regional district though the more relevant reference is in the such and so mountain range or in the x country valley in bc there s lots of historical region references of the nicola country shuswap country omineca country type  sometimes capitalized  though often not  and often just the shuswap the okanagan the omineca etc  and regional district names  and also electoral district names  are often built out of them e g  columbia shuswap  okanagan similkameen  but i ve also seen  trans lated categories articles saying fraser valley when meaning the fraser valley regional district  the problem is that only half of the fraser valley is even in the regional district of that name  the rest is in the greater vancouver one and similarly the cariboo regional district doesn t include all of the cariboo  and itself includes a region known as the chilcotin i ve created categories for most of those areas  and a parallel hierachy for same  but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries can t be cited easily  even though they re what people actually use and historically pre date even the province itself there s some subcategories using that format e g  category people from the similkameen  where the similkameen the similkameen country and also category cariboo people  although that s largely intended for historical figures from that region s glory days during the cariboo gold rush and since in the way british columbians actually talk  so and so is from the thompson nicola regional district would mean that that person works for the thompson nicola regional district most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person myself  i d like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that  the rationale is that some other long ago wikipedian created the hierarchy and so we should respect that even though that person  to me  was utterly clueless and shouldn t have created them at all the only thing the main rd categories should be used for is the component municipalities  though there are some electoral areas that have articles  but ti s when those start getting used as geographic descriptors  it s entirely offbase  it s all over googlemaps and wikimaps  too  and it s really annoying to see  similarly the use of the french form of indian reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hell s half digital acreage because it s what statscan  wrongly  uses as if statscan were the only classification system and as if real people talked like bureaucrats in ottawa do anyway sorry for the rant  it s been rare for me to find,2b2daaab747c1b88,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

115692,13091,ok  sorry for the delay in responding properly from what i can tell  the bare facts of the matter are that you made edits to a number of lds related articles  and those edits were reverted by various editors  myself included now  there are two main ways of viewing these facts  one  that your edits were consistent with wikipedia policy and the editors who reverted them were not justified in doing so  two  that your edits were not consistent with wikipedia policy and the other editors were justified in reverting them this is why i asked you about your understanding of wikipedia policy  you are relatively new here  and despite your confidence that your edits were appropriate  my view of them was that they violated several policies and guidelines  it s natural for newcomers to take some time learning the ropes  so it doesn t imply any malice on your part  since the heart of the conflict seems to be how you and i regard your edits in light of wp policy  it seems best to isolate the points of policy where our understanding differs  in hopes that we can establish areas of common ground from which we can work out other differences  or at least agree about what we irreconcilably disagree it would be helpful  though  to know that you ve indeed read the pertinent policies  so that we can speak with the same lingo and refer to the same general ideas have you done this thanks  talk ,22aa18c65ff3f521,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

33164,45978, jehovah s witnesses related question hi jeffro i don t remember ever actually writing any wikipedia comments before  so forgive me if my formatting ends up wonky  i was just looking for lists of watchtower publications to help me with my collection  when i stumbled across this page and section https en wikipedia org wiki list of watch tower society publications primary study aids  https en wikipedia org wiki talk list of watch tower society publications study aids  the heading these publications are intended to convert interested individuals struck me as a bit jarring and out of place  for one  the immediate next header is secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism so it is not even consistent  secondly  i am not sure that i agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header  as it includes original research  private interpretation of primary sources  and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed  e g how does a s kingdom ministry support the statement that studies in the scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals thirdly and lastly  making statements about intent is always notoriously difficult and subject to conflicting interpretation  while making statements of fact is much simpler and should be preferred  with that in mind  a possible alternative header might be something like these publications are generally considered prior to baptism it is concise  clear  consistent with the other headers and doesn t make assumptions about intent  only fact  may i have your thoughts you have previously commented at wikipedia talk pages  and you had mastered wiki formatting such as indenting at the time  you also referred to yourself in the third person a few times  i hope you ve recovered from that oddity the intended purpose of the  bible study  program offered by jehovah s witnesses most definitely is to convert individuals to the jw faith  though the students are not told of that goal at the outset of the study  for example your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth  qualify as an unbaptized publisher  and become a dedicated and baptized witness of jehovah our kingdom ministry  april page chapter of what does the bible really teach pages your alternative wording would therefore be misleading  because the students don t start out with any intention of being baptised as members of the religion they just think they re  learning more about the bible your wording would only be suitable if the order of events was a  a person wants to be baptised as a jw  b  they study the necessary literature  c  they get baptised  i have added references to the article supporting the fact that the publications are used with the goal of converting individuals  pediainsight can you supply diffs of plagiarism copyvios  if that is genuinely what the user is doing then i have this shiny banhammer in my tool belt  guy for a few examples previously indicated  see user talk pediainsight citations  more recently  his edits at homeopathy plagiarised an extract of dana ullman s book  if you d like other specific examples  please advise which ones  line breaks thanks for your contributions to the tonga adventist article  a minor point  you have been removing line breaks from the end of sentences  see wikipedia manual of style accessibility text  do not insert line breaks within a sentence  since this makes it harder to edit with a screen reader  a single line break may f,7adcdccc646a0269,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

3853,115893,  here is the explanation of the legal side of capital maintenance as quoted directly from the capital maintenance concept and share repurchases in south african law by f h i cassim and rehana cassim  the capital maintenance concept the south african companies act of adopts a strange and a curios ambivalence towards the nineteenth century common law concept of the maintenance of the share capital of a company  in some respects  the companies act still clings to this archaic and outdated concept  while in other respects  it boldly sweeps away the concept and replaces it with the more modern twins tests of liquidity and solvency as a form of creditor protection according to the capital maintenance concept  the issued share capital of a company is seen as a guarantee fund or a permanent fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of a company  with the result that the issued share capital of a company may not be reduced  nor may it be returned to shareholders except where the companies act or the common law authorizes it  thus  lord halsbury  l c in the ooregum gold mining company of india ltd v roper declared that t he capital is fixed and certain  and every creditor of the company is entitled to look to that capital as his security this was echoed some eight decades later in cohen no v segal where the court  in prohibiting the payment of a dividend out of share capital  proclaimed that w  hate ver has been paid by a member cannot be returned to him and no part of the corpus of the company can be returned to a member so as to take away from the fund to which the creditors have a right to look as that out of which they are to be paid  the capital may be spent or lost in carrying on the business of the company  but it cannot be reduced except in the manner and with the safeguards provided by the statute  in accordance with this concept  ss and of the companies act prohibit a company from issuing its shares at a discount unless certain stringent precautions have been complied with  section prohibits a company from paying interest on shares out of share capital unless this is authorised by the articles of association of the company or by a special resolution  the interest paid is restricted to a maximum of six per cent per annum  and the approval of the minister of industries  commerce and tourism has been obtained  f h i cassim ll b cum laude ll m  um laude university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa  advocate of the high court of south africa  associate professor of law  university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa  consultant with bowman gilfillan inc  rehana cassim ba  cum laude ll b cum laude university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa bowman gilfillan inc these statutory provisions find their roots in the capital maintenance concept  but it no longer makes any sense to preserve them in their present form  because instead of complying with the burdensome requirements of s a company may now simply make a payment including dividend payments in terms of s as amended in whether out of capital or profits  to its shareholders provided that this is authorised by its articles of association and that it satisfies the tests of liquidity and solvency as explained below a company may  if it so desires  prohibit in its articles of association such payments section abandons the common law concept of capital maintenance and together with it the fundamental common law principle that dividends may only be paid out of distributable profits  unlike english law  ss and which regulated reductions of share capital have been repealed by s of the companies amendment act of with the result that there is no longer any statutory procedure for the reduction of a company s share capital  expect in accordance with s of the companies act  perhaps this conflict in the underlying philosophy and policy of the south african companies act is a direct result of the patchwork and piecemeal reform that has taken place in south african corporate law during the year existence of the companies act of by way of contrast  ss of the uk companies act have preserved the statutory procedures and regulations relating to reductions of share capital  share repurchases another vital aspect of the reform of the capital maintenance concept is the right conferred by s of the companies act  as amended by s of the companies amendment act of to enable companies to purchase their own shares  until south african corporate law was one of the few remaining common law jurisdictions which continued to pr,6bacb00b493f82a5,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

21514,42383, definition  tabin this proposal  i will discuss why the wikipedia definition for probability  is not a good  valid definition  and needs to be changed  probability is something that is used every day  it is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain  however  in order to further our knowledge of probability  we must truly understand the definition of the word first  according to wikipedia  there is not a clear  valid definition for probability  and i propose to change this user nparibello njitwill summer probability  tabthe given wikipedia definition is as follows  probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain the proposition of interest is usually of the form will a specific event occur the attitude of mind is of the form how certain are we that the event will occur the certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number  between and we call probability the higher the probability of an event  the more certain we are that the event will occur  thus  probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a  random event will occur the opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is  it begins with  probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain  the word ordinarily is not only ambiguous  but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about  aside from the ambiguity  the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well  although i am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree  but also on my own to further my knowledge  i still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant  i would not consider probability an attitude of mind  because this simply does not make sense  the proposition of interest and attitude of mind are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability  probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event tabthe given wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is  rather than defining it  it states that  the proposition of interest is usually of the form this is not only an example instead of a definition  but it is an extremely poor example  the word usually is very vague  leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time  the definition also ends with probability in an applied sense  but what does that really mean  because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to  this makes the definition unclear  tabthe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between and for anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense  this definition most likely makes little sense  the way it is written is very vague  but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from the event will definitely not occur to the event will definitely occur these ranges are also often written in percent form to i believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages  the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid  the range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome  while this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability  i would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense  even though definitions should not include examples  for example  the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is or this is because there are two possible outcomes  heads or tails  and both are equally likely  if the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides  the probability of landing heads would be or since there are no other possible outcomes  as stated in the original definition  the higher the probability of an event  the more certain we are that the event will occur  tabtwo good quality sources comes from richard l  sheaffer in his book  introduction to probability and its applications  and glenn shaffer in his book probability and finance  both sheaffer and shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges  including njit  both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability  making them two of the best sources for this proposal  from a mathematical standpoint  richard sheaffer states that probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number p a  to every event a so that the following axioms hold  p a and p s glenn shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy  les,71139ef5b18eb352,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

47848,21196, team roster moved from user talk kevin mce  hi there  i wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited wp crystal  i m not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate  thanks  i don t know what needs to be explained we cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year  because we do not know the future an encyclopaedia reports facts  not expectations  hi again  firstly  i moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow  i am still not clear exactly what at wp crystal makes this content inappropriate  this is not a predicted team roster  it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of team sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for and then that not happening must be very slim  it is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year  that is in the preceding paragraph and i would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that a roster  not a word that should be used on an article about a uk subject  but that is a different matter  is not something that exists in and even as a speculative list  it is so incomplete as to be meaningless  it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles  but these are not the point returning to the crystal balling issue  you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim  you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility  and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact let s hope it doesn t happen  but sky might go bust  or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury  before january  in which case will arrive  they will not be part of the team  and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error facts  not expectation  i will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in doesn t mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in and that the team might not even exist  however  all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in that makes them part of the squad for we re not simply expecting them to be  they are confirmed to be  surely though  we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen  i think you are misinterpreting wp crystal  i d suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable  as is the case here  if it turns out that any or all of these riders don t ride for team sky in then the wikipedia article won t have been guilty of having recorded an error because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available  i m not saying that it won t happen  nor that it is not very likely  but that it is expectation  not fact you speak of verifiability  but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable if they were to die before the end of this year  they will not be in the team  the future is not confirmed an entirely accurate description of something that does not currently exist is not possible  and as a description  a man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate i find your position on this matter a little strange  you seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so  seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change  the names that are being announced are for the squad  so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such  we can  and should  only base the article on what can be verified at the current time  and that is that the riders named are part of the team for the information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in and our article is  and should  only ever be based upon information available at the time  i would note that  not only has another user reverted the change you made which i am concerned about here  but also that a further ten names have been announced,37e9d340151a8d1f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

45997,150900, someone keeps erasing this with no comment to me very unethical  minutes after posting this it was erased  check it out  this is very suspicious and unethical by the parties involved  senior management  if in existence  asked to investigate please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article  hello  my name is johnhistory  i was recently  block  for my mentioning of major problems here because i did not assume good faith when confronted with bad faith  i believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the jimbo guidelines to the t  i am going to post what i wrote on my talk page after being  block  during the controversy here  i could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the wiki elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny  this surely does not make me popular amongst them  yet i must assume good faith in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process  i was accused of supporting things i never did  all i ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents  that is all  i don t especially care about rev wright  etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then i will stick my neck out for it  i have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased  that is what struck me about the discussion page mind you i never made an edit on the actual article i was banned for merely talking on a talk page  it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group  think environment  thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public controlled by a small group of ideologues wikipedia  these political minding ideologues are dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions  these  not just mine  are non threatening non  offensive language just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be  block  and potentially banned for not assuming good faith or positively contributing to the consensus what if the consensus is wrong then  what if about if you have already assumed good faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it  the evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing obama with w bush  additionally  the obama administration through proxies  in my strong opinion  is at work in the obama article  i say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion  as is understandable  that someone out of the thousands of obama connected likely people is not involved on the barack obama page  it is the most visited page on wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name barack obama  however  that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes  the number of those is in the millions  that is why jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a real encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work  the language given the rulers of wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with  often the language is contradictory  for instance i was  block  for my comments on the talk page and cited for making a point instead of wanting to edit how  exactly  do you make a talk page based discussion about edits without making a point  another monitor told me i had to assume good faith  yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article  in addition  the talk page says no writing will be allowed that involves general discussion however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts  additionally  the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the president of the united stat,73de058fa17673a5,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
