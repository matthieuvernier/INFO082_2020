6530,142583,  in an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool  which is called the interpreter and executed what command by command no interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays  taw from interpreted language talk some languages  like perl  are compiled at runtime  could you elaborate taw  every time a perl script is run  perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code  at least  this is the usual way of using perl  although it s not the only way  zundark dec you mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code taw i believe it s compiled to bytecode  much like java  as of perl version it s possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step  i think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well  but i m not as sure about that  indigo perl  http w indigoperl com  produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable  but i think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode  so they tend to be rather large  their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don t necessarily have the perl interpreter installed they have versions for both windows and unix ish platforms wesley old interpreted language article an interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code  but is interpreted at run time by the computer  and  trans lated into machine understandable code as required it is often a mistake to refer to a language as either interpreted or compiled because most languages can be implemented in either way  and some languages  like perl  are compiled at runtime but behave as if they were interpreted  other languages  like java  may be partially compiled into an intermediate form which is then interpreted  although that  too  might be compiled some languages  though  are specifically designed to favor interpretation an example of an interpreted language is javascript is java interpreted  or what the java programming language article says the first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability  and many implementations still do  these implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully compiled programs created by the typical c compiler and some later java language compilers  so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs  more recent implementations of the java vm produce programs that run much faster  using multiple techniques  the java language is compiled  always it is designed as a compiled language  and is implemented as a compiled language it is often compiled into bytecode  which is then interpreted  with a virtual machine i think the java language article is correct  but maybe it could be worded better ldc  yes  and you can also compile jave straight down to machine code if you like  the above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is imho incorrect  every language that has an eval statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code  you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code  axelboldt  way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of compiling it is used in two distinct meanings  as in compiled to machine code  or assembly compiled to byte code parse tree some other internal representation  i think it s wrong to call languages that use the second way compiled in such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use no language uses line by line parsing nowadays  all compile source to some form of internal representation quote from foldoc compiler a program that converts another program from some  source language or  programming language to machine language object code some compilers output assembly language  which is then converted to  machine language  by a separate  assembler ,faa8c48969b0d37f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

33759,5010, just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone  and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail in some cases it is probably appropriate  and actually used just like a surname  in a legitimate but different  broader sense than that used by our surname article  and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere  by the person that s probably especially true of radio personalities with an on air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name  i ve seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names but as a general rule  no  some like ann margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen  the problem  of course  is that our articles  especially the stubs and sub stubs  often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on if it is mary lou or something of the sort  common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname  especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself  it should clearly be under m in any category  the redirect which should be there  or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page  could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories  and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful but in between  there is a huge variety that you ll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories  and there are lots of them  even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn t even appear in the article s own name  ,0d4825e86a401840,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49653,83935, the main things i disagree about the haunted castle post  no one realized that lives had been lost until later that night  when firefighters searching one of the burnt out trailers discovered the bodies  thought at first to be mannequins  this is not true  this was reported in our local papers as well  the night of the fire  the media were told almost nothing  and had to go by rumor  i spoke to the fire chief  as well as numerous others on the scene that night  you see  except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers  where the walls were not made of plywood  everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash  the bodies were discovered before dark  as soon as the fire was extinguished  not much later in the night  the firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains  bones  blood  jew elry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile i ve seen the photos  additionally  the stench of burned flesh was overpowering  being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit  separated only by a chain link fence from the haunted castle trailers  wax mannequins would have been long since melted the truth is that the management at first claimed  and might have believed  to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the hc  and there was no reason to close the park  the  castle was isolated  so the fire couldn t spread to other buildings  the fire was out by and the park closed at p m  i ve never heard of sfga kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night  with fair weather with a free return pass  an unprecedented decision was made and implemented in minutes  given this time frame  they clearly found the bodies instantly  and there wasn t time to think that they were mannequins eight days after the fire  a statement by the ocean county prosecutor s office said a year old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses  the boy told the police that he had been befriended by a year old boy at the castle s entrance  he said the older youth  who appeared to be familiar with the castle  offered to guide him through  he said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light  and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam rubber wall pad  the prosecutor exonerated the older youth  who has never been identified  of any criminal wrongdoing  police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning  and interviewed both saturday may th the younger boy s parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast  the older boy was turned in by his teacher  who had seen him unattended  exit a burning haunted castle  and alerted police as soon as he could  this boy set numerous fires  bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it  try to reproduce such a thing  it takes about seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam  it is unclear why the prosecutor didn t go after him  according to news reports of the trial  no such boy was ever found  and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy  under cross examination by the defense  the witness denied starting the fire himself  although its true as it is quote from the article  the identity of the boy was well known to investigators i think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill fated group  the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property  as well as numerous other facts thanks  ,e09541c11b335fa6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

29685,143053, i never said they would be expelled i said they do not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout the only way an avowed homo sex  can both understand and agree to live by the scout oath and law is to lie of course  he is also violating his promise to be trustworthy in the process  he does not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout he intentionally violates the scout oath and law  and he intents to continue violating the scout oath and law but he could join and remain in scouting nonetheless  by telling lies i imagine  at any given time  there are thousands of scouts who are regularly violating the scout oath and law  who intend to continue doing so  and still remain in scouts but that doesn t change the fact the scout oath is what it is  that bsa believes that homo sex  behavior violates the scout oath  and that these scouts are not qualified to be scouts  the first amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group s policy to be  expressive association the courts may not interfere on the ground that they view a particular expression as unwise or irrational and beliefs need not be acceptable  logical  consistent  or comprehensible to others to merit first amendment protection the fact that many scouts disagree with bsa beliefs  ignore bsa beliefs  disobey bsa beliefs  or that anyone finds bsa beliefs to be inconsistent  irrational  or unwise  does not take away bsa s right to assert and hold their beliefs  ,fcf1d8b8d185a3bb,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

99946,148404,in response  dear lessheard vanu and to wikipedia including all editors and administrators mr  wales this is a very serious issue we contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia s own editors and administrators as with blackpearl who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don t apply to her  and with other editors who uphold double standards  then when challenged to the double standards  including blackpearl s violation of wikipedia s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control  other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia s own written polices  lessheard vanu had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a harassing the editor outright agreeing with blackpearl then in addition to ip address being  block all talk discussion are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors administrators  all of this has been recorded  including that blackpearl having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page  copies have been secure that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her these statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia s own written polices and purpose yet you have ignored that as previously written in discussion  per wikipedia s own written polices  but immediately deleted by blackpearl and then sanctioned by lessheard vanu blackpearll calls herself evidently mrs  johnny depp and pirate lord ess and such she celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean for wikipedia  why would someone devote so much time to check the site and on these pages  and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn t follow her bias views vandals  attackers and such  has her judgement become impaired her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean is very clear that is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia s own written polices sorry  but if one purchases products  such as pirates of the caribbean posters  toys and walt disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia wikinews articles  doesn t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest  as recorded  blackpearl s pages regarding this issue are one sided  not neutral  are bias  in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean  yes  pirates of the caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral  they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the walt disney company  following wikipedia s own written neutral policy  entire articles would have to be deleted  yet blackpearl continues to violate wikipedia polices and purpose  then with ip s being deliberately  block  and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things  if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to pirates of the caribbean following wikipedia s own written polices  editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason  to delete those articles and ban the ip user  they use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts  it s a total lock out by the editors and administrators  abusing their trust tools  acting like a private monarchy  to date  blackpearl s has proven she has ultimate control  has repeatedly stated that is her purpose  and had even sought to have the articles locked  then you lessheard vanu wrote that you don t want to lock these articles  stating it goes against company policy  but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as vandals and harassing the editors etc other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include svtcobra and whoville and chris mann we have documented that they say one thing  yet practice another  we have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers  we contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and admin,4bdace3027e6e2fd,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

45073,103593, september utc  the only lesson i learned for about the umpteenth time is that wikipedia is a complete pile of garbage  which is why i edit from an ip and can t even be bothered to create a username that grand slam article is a great example of everything that s wrong with wikipedia it s a terribly written article in which two authors are responsible for almost the entire content i nicely corrected a false statement  which you reverted  and then you edited to no longer be false  but instead completely unnecessary and redundant you refused to accept an edit to your page  threatened to report me to admins  crying to mommy  for accusing you of owing the page  when you and one other user wrote the entirety of the content and refuse to accept corrections  even when the corrections aren t even a matter of content but rather the awful writing on the page i ve come across other people on wikipedia who revert all edits to their pages and it s ridiculous that this behavior is tolerated i can switch my ip address whenever i choose by resetting my router  i only appealed the block because i want to report that awful page to the baseball project and want it to be internally consistent  you are completely delusional if you think putting an edit war template on the page of someone who page two edits and threatening to report them to the admins for their first edit is anything other than spreading all this vitriol of  hate i sincerely hope you really are a child and not an adult  because if you re an adult and act this immature  you are in need of serious help ,2a452e4672b85e2d,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

27279,86679, hoover s murder investigation re kennedy the information about hoover s role in the murder investigation of president kennedy is well documented hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of president john f  kennedy which is often called the crime of the century  the first citation in the kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the house select committee on assassinations  it issued its report in after a three year investigation into the assassination of john kennedy  martin luther king  and robert kennedy  the report by the congressional committee was critical of the performance by the fbi as well as other agencies  the second citation in the section on the kennedy murder is to the pbs frontline news show  it was reviewing the official government records that electrified top washington insiders and have been kept secret for over years  these secret documents were obtained by the assassination records review board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure  the once secret documents are fascinating  especially as reviewed by pbs  hoover conferred with nicholas katzenbach of the justice department about how to approach an investigation of kennedy s murder  the former attorney general was grilled by the hsca years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in kennedy s assassination  the copy of his memo is carried by lancer if the reader wants the full version of the testimony by katzenbach the reader should go to the house committee report president johnson  along with hoover  also knew about the oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be oswald trying to contact a hit man  maybe there would be another motive for impersonating oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him  i don t know what it would be  there is no question the fbi  under hoover  acted as the primary investigative arm of the warren commission  and hoover testified to the commission as seen from these once secret  trans cripts of the warren commission hearing i have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of president kennedy the testimony is unsealed now there is no secret anymore about the fbi destruction of evidence  they were caught and its now public knowledge  there is a full pulic record  the agent involved even wrote a book about it  the american public does not believe the conclusions reached by the warren commission and believes the government has something to hide this is what the assassination records review board believes  conclusion  therefore  any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in  one should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn t like it  if that were the criteria for deleting information  then wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country  nothing negative can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a theory  no  the information is documented by reputable sources what i can t figure out is why mr  hoover s  sex  life gets so much space  and yet someone doesn t want information on hoover s job performance on the biggest case of hoover s career  ,e7d218d5fb8777ed,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

38794,50575, ok  the convention on naming appears to be falling by the wayside  some cities articles  ie  toronto  montreal  are titled as the city s name only while others  chicago  winnipeg  calgary  vancouver  are burdened with having the state or province following the city in the article title  in response to your omment below the full name of toronto is toronto  ontario  canada which is unnecessarily long as an article name  besides  wikipedia articles use the most common name  not the full name of article subjects  e g united states  not united states of america and united kingdom  not united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland wikipedia is an international encyclopedia  not a north american one  so the article title should be what readers around the world will think of first  not just those in north america  many people outside of canada have not heard of ontario  even though they know about toronto  let s just leave keep it simple  and keep the existing redirect from toronto  ontario to toronto ground zero t  and seeing that you are administrator please re name the winnipeg  manitoba  calgary  alberta  edmonton  alberta  and vancouver  british columbia articles to winnipeg calgary edmonton and vancouver respectively their full names ie  winnipeg  manitoba  canada  are unnecessarily long and readers worldwide know of these cities even if they have not heard of manitoba  alberta  or british columbia  as you suggest  let s keep it simple  we should not imply that toronto  montreal  and ottawa  by the way  both vancouver and calgary are larger than ottawa  are in a different league  so let s say that all canadian cities of over should stand on their own  we ll make up our own rules as we go along  thanks  i hope you are able to do this soon  ,873cbd73498b3f20,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

116885,114347,oops i was just about to post this before you posted yours i might as well anyways furthermore  as far as internal textual evidence goes  there are certain things which clearly show that this could not be the work of ptolemy for example  several of the aphorisms make explicit references to horary astrology  which is not something that ptolemy addressed at all in the tetrabiblos one of the reasons for this  among others  is that interrogational astrology  ie  horary  was not developed until the  nd and  rd centuries and this development occurred in india within the hindu tradition see pingree pg horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of hellenistic astrology from which ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on  and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the middle ages when the various arab and persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the indian  persian and hellenistic traditions so you see  even the internal evidence in the text itself with the references to horary show that this could not have been the work of claudius ptolemy ,639814cb943eca41,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

15823,86457, aha  so  it is not about bessarabia  it is about soviet demands over bessarabia  i think this is the core issue of numerous misunderstandings  if we start from analyzing what the soviets demanded and see that romania and the west did not made sufficient steps to apease it  we observe insuficient action from the side of romania  did not organize a referendum as well as from the west  did not succeed in overthrowing the reds to try is not enough but also we run into which obviously ties the hands of romania  w hate ver you say  it was much more important for romania to have normal relations with the rest of the world than with russia but i said from early on  that bessarabia  not russia is the center of the issue  it is bessarabians that chose this or that  not romania or russia  russia had intervened only in without being invited by a local body or by mps from bessarabia  without even a mock support from inside bessarabia  why should russia s demand be treated supperior to bessarabia s choice  good or bad  it was a choice made in full awareness the  military  treaty you mention was signed in february  i e  before march between two neighboring to bessarabia countries  it can not possibly tie the hands of bessarabia itself  by then an independent country about autonomy  as far as i know  after the november  resp december union of bukovina  resp trans ylvania  a government was set for the entire united romania  led by a  trans ylvanian politician  alexandru vaida voevod he was too liberal for the phanariot minded politicians that used to govern in bucharest before  they tolerated new romanians in government only becuse the circumstances made that necessary  among other things  vaida started a large campain of land reform  widely supported also by bukovinians and bessarabians  but very feared by the old ruling elite in bucharest  recall the peasant uprising  still very fresh in mind they tollerated vaida s governments  there were or i think  for ca year  and in early a black coalition was formed  and general averescu became prime minister  similar to the one formed in romania in early against basescu  which lamenably failed within month  but dragged the country more into politicianist discourse until last autumn land reform was limited and only went as far as to finish what was started  the new constitution of was written by these people  who put the word unitary everywhere they could fit it into  thus the autonomy of all three new provinces was not enshrined in the new constitution  in return that led to a bitter division of the politics  on one side national liberal party of bucharest old politicians  on the other the  trans ylvanian dominated national  r  nist party  in the latter started to gain momentum  and to sealed it they brought in carol ii from forced exile  but carol ii turned to be even worse  so they actually shut themselves into leg  so to say  that led some of them to more nationalistic discurse  for example vaida himself dahn even calls him fascist  which is not true  but i don t want to argue with dahn others managed to escape this trap  for example maniu you see  you have to take into consideration the entire going ons  bessarabia was left without regional autonomy because no other province got it  which in turn was because the old phanariot mineded people carried the day in early s  these people lost the grip on power  but it took time  even in modern romania you still have the continuation of the same disputes  on one side you have many politicians asking for setting up regions and more local autonomy  again  surprisingly many  trans ylvanians among them on the other side you have the command system minded partly communist foprmed bureaucracy  who fear regionalization  again  surprizingly many oltenians and other likes of them among but unlike the interbelic period  it seem that now the movement is strictly oriented in one direction  regionalization and greater local autonomy is inevitable  whether you bring the eu standard pretext or not  so  my second part of the answer is  if it were not for the soviet occupation  the rise of fascism  and wwii  we would have had autonomy for bessarabia  with a powerful local legislative body  by s  communism only created a pause  things continue to roll today talk  ,e73ec52b13786c3f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

5316,54656,  i m enjoying the holiday  the nice thing about beating your head against the wall  it feels good when you stop  why should i put up with the sons of betacommand  when i can work at source with charles matthews  i am not alone  just go look at all the veteran editors at other projects who won t come back  look at all the expert editors  who stopped editing because they were bitten  this attitude that editors are a dime a dozen  is a limiting factor in the quality of wikipedia just so we re clear this is about interpretation of policy  not policy itself we have editors nominating for deletion  because a fair use image would make it harder to email and get a free image  we have editors nominating for deletion  because in the era of digital cameras  a free image of the recently dead must exist  look harder we have editors nominating for deletion  because an image in a book exists  go scan the book even it was printed in and the photographer is unknown  this image would be challenged at commons since the source and copyright status is unknown  we have editors nominating for deletion  because the newspaper photo could be a commercial source although no proof of commercial source exists we have admins removing fair use images from articles without discussion  then letting the bot delete the new orphan image  i m curious why i should agree to anything  what is my motivation  as a counteroffer  i will agree to a month topic ban  if a permanent interaction ban is agreed to  with editor b  and b they will not comment on my talk  they will not nominate my uploads  since they do so little work in article space  i can stay away from them  if the policy is so clear  another admin can handle it  and it will remove even the perception that a personal agenda is being pursued here turning the tables since this is the popular sophistical trick  why would i want to come back  what can you offer me to edit here again  i ve quit aversive leadership for money  why would i want to put up with it for free ,92144f50666492f1,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49979,6733, the punk rock page has more meat in the text and its a lot of text content then a photo so the glance is in favor of the text i do see some areas that can be fleshed out i think the hardcore page wouldn t work with every section in depth like theirs  thats what makes this page also unique to hardcore but i do think that some sections here are too small and that would work to balance out the photos to keep the text the main teaching and learning tool i would like to resize the photo of zines a little smaller even if it has to be re uploaded then it might now be too much and too busy people read to retain information the right set up enhances that too many pictures are a distraction they take away from the knowledge more fleshed out sections can help ill brainstorm on that until later i guess add the picture  if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little  maybe it will balance itself out more  the third option is we can fill out some sections more make it more balanced and then add the zines  photo  after  so it accentuates and isn t the meat and potatoes of the section the sections of influence on other genres that could be good place to start adding more content depth ill study some other pages meanwhile when i get a chance then bring that knowledge here a little later thanks a lot i love to share knowledge and i like sharing that here for free ,11f01d2923b49137,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

117778,114,paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however  the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate  invertebrates  radiolarians  sponges  plants  pollen  foot prints  etc and multiple processes may include permineralization  recrystalization  carbonization  replacement  dissolving  diagenesis  etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue  however quick burial is not questioned the major question is  how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab  which of course implies that given the right conditions  vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood  but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet  how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with ,004b975fabbbffa9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

53179,79476, utc i agree with user man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading see this quote about  or maybe from edward tufte before the development of spreadsheet graphing  the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist drawn d images with the height of d objects representing the magnitude of the data points in these charts  both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points the effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude source the image suggests that the tsar bomba  which was three or four times more powerful than castle bravo  is actually times larger in volume  or x larger in area if explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield  not really accurate  but much closer than this chart  the tsar bomba mushroom cloud would be x taller than castle bravo and x taller than hiroshima instead  the diagram shows the cb and tb over a thousand times taller  on this scale  one could conclude that since the hiroshima bombing s mushroom cloud was about four miles high  the tsar bomba explosion x taller  must be larger than the earth itself july ,d4a81de0018d6383,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

91783,90379,i have just read the source  i think you are very right  it is about global health but again not about medical tourism which is a subcategory of globalized healthcare driven by the patient movement  for example the reference article starts with the example of dave who had traveled to tanzania as a part of global health rotation  in this case  tanzania is neither the medical destination nor the developed country with collapsed or collapsing social health care system therefore no interest to medical tourism studies  it is clearly not relevant to the medical tourism  i think if medical tourism would be defined with economics terms such as imports and exports  by the way i do not like it in this way  just to clarify we might not be so confused  like developing countries  medical tourism destinations  are the exporters and the developed countries are the importers  i would suggest to remove such texts and references which are out of topic  even though some of them are quite interesting for other studies ,f1dfec6c9fe04ca6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

12345,156993,  true  caste community related stuff are really difficult to grasp immediately given the complex nature of indian society  i can understand that you need more time to fully analyse the issue  take your own time and i am always there to help you in case you need more references we have agreed to maintain the original content till the discussion is over  an anon have edited the article without any references and you have reverted it partially  change it back to original content as of nov by the way  any updates from your side you can take your own time but make sure to maintain the original content we need to maintain the original version till the dispute is resolved  anonymous edits and partial reverting will only lead to more confusions  if people continue to edit  i propose to remove all caste names from the article till the dispute is resolved  sorry  i thought that i had fully reverted the ip  anyway  i ve read all the english items  in some cases more than once i can see that the gounder community phrase is used in the sense of meaning the kv community  but that is only apparent if there is a hook in the article to give it some context  eg  an article talks abour the kmk  you know that kmk kv  and so when it then says gounder community then the context makes it is obvious that they mean kv  i ve not explained that particularly well  but short version  yes  in the examples gounder community kv the problem is  that is not good enough  you cannot prove that the term is not used to refer to other groups of gounder than the kv  nor could i find a really clear cut example among the english language sources  all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background eg  that kmk kv party  sure  you know that but someone born bred in the uk or usa  germany or guatemala  australia and austria most probably will not  in that sense  you are engaging in synthesis  and we are not allowed to do that here you said that the tamil sources were important  are they really going to resolve the issues that i raise  in particular  is even one of them going to explicitly say that the term is used either always or most frequently to refer to kvs none of them will say  gounder always refers to kvs because there are other communities too that are using the title  but you need to view from another angle  why other communities  non kvs  are not referred as just gounder community because  all the sections of vettuvars  vanniyars  vokkaligas don t use gounder title  only some sections of those communities use the title and hence they cannot be generally referred as gounder community  this gives the freedom to refer kvs as gounder community  all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background eg  that kmk kv party this is not very difficult  we can attach this reference along with other references to prove that kmk or kmp kv party  anyway  if this not enough  here is another reference which says about gounder community  taken from deccan chronicle persons belonging to kongu vellalar are mentioned as persons from gounder community to prove that  gounder community mentioned here refers to kongu vellalar  i have attached the proof here  which says sengottaiyan is a kongu vellalar  no need to infer from kmp or kmk  this reference will directly establish that gounder community mentioned refers to kongu vellalar  user mahevenki mahevenki,d6bc89bb80146d8f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

17681,48899, at the very least  there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of munsell chips  one that is in the public domain is at the server was awfully slow when i tried to access the links with the ascii data files  i had better luck with click the squares for reflectance data  this website is cited in  for instance fernando ayala  jos f  ech  varri  pilar renet  and angel i  negueruela  use of three tristimulus values from surface reflectance spectra to calculate the principal components for reconstructing these spectra by using only three eigenvectors  j  opt  soc  am  a abstract the article cites the website above as ref one of the classic sources also cited in the paper above seems to be  kenneth l  kelly  kasson s  gibson  and dorothy nickerson  tristimulus specifications of the munsell book of color from spectrophotometric measurements  j  opt  soc  am abstract the kuehni book i mentioned above lists a bunch of other sources  you can browse it search inside if you have an amazon com account  used at least once to purchase something from amazon com itself here incidentally  i now realize that these sources may give enough information to settle the very question i posed  but to really settle it  i would first need the answer to the following  was i wrong in the identification of the munsell s color in my initial posting  that is what is the identity in the munsell system of the munsell color to which the wikipedia article is referring  is it in fact  rp having realized my probable mistake above  now i don t understand something else  look at this statement in the article professional artists  following munsell color system regard purple as being synonymous with the red violet color shown at right  in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet in what sense are artists supposed to be following munsell here  obviously not in nomenclature  is it the case that the artists do use munsell s colors in their work  but change the names  e g  munsell s purple artist s violet  and munsell s red purple artist s purple i d rewrite this if i understood what is attempted to be said here  ,82bb3f5417d76358,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
30194,156431, i think you have done a great job with the page  and i learned a lot from reading it and the other comments posted above i like that you were able to make use of some of the information we covered in class specifically related to this topic  but were also able to include plenty of outside resources many of the concerns i had have been addressed in prior comments  but there is one section that i find slightly unclear it may just be the way i am reading your wording  but i figure there is always a chance that someone else will take it the same way and have the same question i do in the toxicology studies section  i think your intention is to say that because the mouse study used very high doses of the protein and proteins that will be toxic are usually toxic at very low doses  evidence supports that the bt toxin is not toxic to mammals  what i initially read  however  was just the phrase research on other known toxic proteins suggests that proteins are usually toxic at low doses  further suggesting that bt toxins are not toxic to mammals which confused me by making it sound like the toxins are almost always toxic at low doses and that the bt toxin might not be safe perhaps changing this wording would help clarify your meaning for future readers just a thought overall  great job  ,ce1b94f62116fcd9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

26749,87935, hi  i was just wondering why you removed my edit on the mackem rivalry page what i added  i believe to be a fact perhaps we could work on making it more neutral if you thought it may offend anyone i am originally from south shields  which is more or less equidistant from the rival cities i am currently however  living in middlesbrough the rivalry in south shields is slightly more noticable since it is geographically and socially directly in the middle  and also because it has more of a mix of necastle united and sunderland afc supporters the rivalry is especially evident in the new town of washington as it seems  i might be wrong  to have approximately an equal amount of geordie and mackem residents i don t want to offend anyone  however  i believe my edit should be included in the article in some form  as it is true that there are a considerable amount of people in both newcastle and sunderland who don t have a clue about the origins of the rivalry they tend to attribute it entirely on football  or in extreme cases  for no reason at all sometimes  whenever a geordie or a mackem makes a reference to the rivalry  i question them most of the time  their response was just don t know why  or because they are scum  and cound not give a reasonable argument let me know how you feel about this  take care  ,eb2fe811bb015c00,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49630,78952, the link you provide states that of the rail market in sweden is privatised that therefore makes saying rail  trans port in sweden is privatised a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government  it doesn t matter whether the rail market was liberalised into different companies under state ownership e g  sj  something cannot be described as privatised if it retains a majority of government ownership  because it is therefore nationalised  the opposite of privatisation  to describe the swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written  rail  trans port market is privatized and companies include sj in this sentence you have made it sound as if sj is a private company which is untrue  since if the person reading clicks the sj hyperlink  they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that sj is a government owned enterprise a much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger  trans port by rail in sweden is operated by state owned companies such as sj as well as the government run lokal trafik in place within each of sweden s l  n such as hallandstrafik  storstockholms lokaltrafik  sk  netrafik etc  etc  etc  and then to explain that some sectors of rail  trans port are privatised such as the  trans port of cargo  this would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above  which states that the majority of rail  trans port in sweden is still government owned  with being privatised since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned  you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned sj isn t the most efficient of rail networks  something which a lot of swedes themselves agree on as far as i have seen  in my own experience delays are common and travelling with sj can be expensive june ,d347113beb94f317,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

22802,44174, editor review hey nish  i m currently up for editor review  i would be most appreciative if you could comment on my wikipedia habits there and offer some advice  thanks in advance  thanks for the editor review  i honestly  truely know that i do not want to become a wikipedia admin  however  i hold the same thoughts towards wikipedia as i do towards the us military  given the choice  i would never join up  but my personal philosophy of national service  i agree with the idea of mandatory national service of some sort  whether it be community service or military  compels me so that i plan to join the us military in some form in the future  the problem i currently face with wikipedia is that i m constantly fighting an uphill battle in both the preservation of information and the adding of new information to wikipedia  often  something that i hope to be small edit becomes a huge issue due to vandalism  edit wars  extremely overly burecratic wikipedians  example  those who like to delete almost every image from topics under the fair use policy etc  i don t want to end up like many of the former admins who came to wikipedia to add information and stayed because they became admins and spent all their time putting out fires  however  as wikipedia will experience exponential growth within the next decade  it will plateau when the internet finally reaches into the third world in a big way and with that growth will come a huge number of vandals  honestly  i believe wikipedia now can use x the number of admins  i can t even imagine how bad it might get on here  with vandals  in a decade or so when the number of admins has grown at a steady pace but the number of vandals is huge due to the rapid growth of wikipedia and the internet in general i would prefer to not be an admin  but i m willing to put up with w hate ver it takes to preserve the good info of wikipedia while ensuring that new info can be added properly any thoughts on this edit  also  i d like to expand my vandal fighting activities  but i m not sure if i should get external programs like vandalproof  i do patrol newpages every now and then  and in the process catch many vandals  however  i usually cannot punish these vandals because of the wp agf policy and the fact that warnings really do nothing to repeat vandals  i ll try my best  alexander litvinenko you left this comment on my talk page  umm you stated that you shortened the intro here as per wp lead  we were discussing the intro on the talk page  and i would have appreciated it if you would go back and discuss the intro s status on the talk page  i am restoring back the intro section  and you can make minor changes if you wish  but please don t make drastic changes without discussing  thanks  by the way  keep up the great work with the article  hopefully we can pull this to ga or fa in the near future  best  nishkid i ve discussed the article on the talk page  the introduction is way too rambling and detailed which is why i shortened it  please read wp lead which recommends it is concise  also some of the sentences don t flow well  the first sentence was a russian security service agent  with a link to fsb  and later a russian dissident is a much better summary than was an ex fsb lieutenant colonel with kgb experience in fighting organized crime  tom in order for the article to have more impact it needs to be more concise you restored back the intro  i e  a major change and said i could make  minor  changes if i wish but  had to discuss drastic ones i hope you realise this is hypocritical  given that you did a major revert without discussing as you know  several people on the talk page have suggested to you that the intro was too long i promise you  the shortened introduction looks and reads better than the longer one the longer one does not summarise what he was in the first sentence including his dissidence  it goes straight into a narrative without any gap after working in it doesn t make sense in english his superiors had ordered for the assassination should be his superiors had ordered the assassination you can t be a dissident of an organisation  see dissident it s got several long contiguous paragraphs instead of short clearly defined ones  anyway  hope you re okay  give us a shout and we can talk about it  it was that you said  don t make drastic changes withou,75f6b25f9cf879d1,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

16496,139002, and just for the record  i  unsurprisingly  sincerely belief that not much new technology will come out of newman s invention  even leaving all the contradictions to physics aside  there is a much more pragmatic argument  any electric motor design which only cut backs losses by going from to efficency  would be of outmost commercial importance  you would be able to go  with bodyguards and lawyers if you prefer  into the development centers of siemens  emd  or bombardier  demonstrate your working prototype and leave as a very rich man  ri heat losses ri  meters ohm current times distance current momentum current momentum can be determined by integrating current along the length of wire  with dl as the derivative length it can be found in the biot savart law  to maximize current momentum heat losses  the following should be maximized  ri  meters ohm ri meters ohm  i cross sectional area of wire resistivity current  but current momentum produces the magnetic field  the square of which is proportional to its energy so to maximize the energy of the magnetic field heat loss  r i meters ohm ri r  meters ohm distance ohm just use a longer wire  i guess the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy  causing electromagnetic radiation  even the simple movement of a charge can cause a magnetic field  causing acceleration  and therefore radiation  if the wire is so short  that is like shorting the battery  e g  connecting them in series  and not using the charges to your advantage  ok  so i d like to start by saying that i may more or less completely misunderstand you  but  apart from a very good remark about the mass to energy conversion your statements look rather heterodox to me  granted  newman would have to have found new physics to make his machine work  but i assume we are discussing textbook physics and ee in this side note  specifically it s not the resistive  heat  losses  or other losses  which bound the electric motor s efficency to even using a supraconducting coil and everything you wish  you won t get above the counter voltage induced by the rotation will make the input power needed to sustain rotation equal to mechanical work done equal amount of copper will give you motors of equal parameters  only with voltages and currents scaled in different  compensating directions  e g  both thse setups will give the same magnetic field and motor operation meter of mm diameter copper wire  about at v and a  stall current  and meter of mm diameter copper wire  about at v and a  stall current but i agree with your guess that the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy  every time some energy is  trans ported away from a system  the system loses mass according to e mc in most cases an unmeasurable low amount  also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies  you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance  exactly that amount of mass will be lost  if we keep the system isolated  its total mass stays the same  e g when letting the two bodys clonking together  the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy  then to heat  and both contribute to the mass of the system  which in effect stays constant but in a motor the movement is periodic  so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of  trans mutate into something other than normal copper  ouch  not exactly briefly  sorry  ,e7de1fa2625e3a28,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

3628,127219,  ha  i know what you want to push in this article  xeeron i found this post in one of the forums  it s not yours  i m sure  but it s logic fits your actions pretty well south ossetia is not independent  russia needs to stay out of the conflict  what happened in georgia was a civil war  this should have played out on its own  russia is not a peacekeeper but instead is biased and should be removed from south ossetia immediately  putin is pissed off because of georgias plans of joining nato and dropping cis like a bad habit  putin wants to keep south ossetia under his wing that way he can build his natural gas pipeline through south ossetia without georgians permissian  russia is a bully and needs to repect georgias sovereignty  putin is too occupied with becoming the new opec  now i see your logic behind calling it a civil war and  what i like most about you  xeeron  is you have a wonderful persistency in your mistakes  let s look at your sources the bbc tells georgia accuses russia of arming the south ossetian authorities who have been trying to break away since the civil war in the s  moscow denies the claim  nothing about civil war in ossetia in it s about georgian civil war  you must have missed this  so points for providing nothing the randbild de beta sounds reliable tells of civil war in don t you claim it s anyway the source is just a blog  blog of a fotographer  having his contacts in huge letters on the  st page  timo vogt  fotograf at randbild punkt de  do you still consider blogs to be reliable sources for providing a non reliable source we re not going to discuss source that tells it s defending marxism right  why don t you just go and write an article about politics based on sources that underline they are created to defend neo nazi sm or neocons then  i think reliable source should be at least not biased  defending  ism is biased  so again for providing a source that is created to defend marxism eurasia net wow  a really interesting source  would it be their opinion  that would be almost enough to claim some sources say so war of was actually a civil war but  to my dissapointment  these are just words of another fotographer jonathan alpeyrie is a war photographer for getty images  i mean  i adore getty  i m even their client for the last two years  but i never knew they were a think tank  did you  a reliable server  but another fotographer that does not count again total points  now back to the point  see what sources do not consider so war to be a civil war  radio free europe opendemocracy net  featuring an article of the english professor of caucasus studies the guardian and finally  that s what your beloved bbc thinks of the war in the twilight of the soviet union  as georgian nationalist zviad gamsakhurdia came to prominence in tbilisi  south ossetia too flexed its separatist muscles  soviet forces were sent to keep the peace in late following violent clashes between georgians and ossetians in the capital  tskhinvali  violence flared again as south ossetia declared its intention to secede from georgia in and  the following year  effective independe,a8646faf68f0cab4,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

55540,42709, why is it that a page that can garner such passionate attitudes  as they concern the treatment and consuming of animals  cannot stick to the subject matter surely  even the most ardent supporter of animal rights can see that this is simply supposed to be a list of material facts about an aspect of human behavior that has existed in one form or another since the dawn of time there are many other places on wikipedia where they can read and contribute their individual viewpoints on the ethical  moral and practical points of animal consumption i do not wish to enter into personal attacks  and will not on an individual level  but there seem to be quite a few people who are either too stupid or too self centered to leave their personal opinions out of an encyclopedia article can anyone imagine opening a copy of an encyclopedia britannica to the slaughterhouses entry only to find a jumbled mess of a few verifiable facts mixed in with opinions and hysterical rants about how terrible are slaughterhouses and meat eaters why can t these people understand that this is simply a webpage that is attempting to describe what is a slaughterhouse  what it does  where they operate  how they operate  and what types of animals they process there would be no opinions stating that slaughterhouses are wonderful  desirable places that exist for the pleasure of some sadistic monsters who kill simply for the pleasure of it likewise  there will not be any sections condemning slaughterhouses and all people who either work there or utilize the products that are produced in such a place this article  once completed satisfactorily  will simply be a repository of verifiable facts about slaughterhouses  their genesis  their necessity  as it stands right now in our modern world and their operating procedures yes  there will be facts about the historical conditions  including  i am sure  mention of upton sinclair s the jungle  also  there will most likely be a small section that notes these vegetarians  and vegans  attitudes and activities concerning slaughterhouses in this aforementioned small section  i can imagine that there will be external links leading to wikipedia pages that support these vegetarians  and vegans  points of view now  what is wrong with that a place for everything  and everything in its place oh  and if you are still confused about what is a fact and what is an opinion  an opinion is explained in detail on a  what else wikipedia page residing here en wikipedia org wiki opinion  and it says something like this  for starters an opinion is a subjective statement or thought about an issue or topic  and is the result of emotion or interpretation of facts  now do you see the difference please say  yes  so that we may move on to more productive pursuits i have to admit that all of the extremely emotional opinions and diatribes are exhausting me  so cut it out please john l  hunter acehall ,71f959240c19cf4f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

11027,151651,  thanks tom that s a much better summary than the previous one  one question  in the comparison of ukip s performance to that of other parties  i think saying that the snp polled less than ukip could be misleading for non uk readers  if i didn t know that the snp only stood candidates in scotland  i d get the impression from the current text that ukip did much better than the snp on average  but knowing that ukip put up candidates across the country  while the snp didn t  gives quite a different impression  since  of course  the snp polled much better than ukip everywhere it put up candidates  so for the benefit of non uk readers  in the section comparing ukip s performance to that of the lib dems and snp  perhaps it might be helpful to add ahead of the scottish national party  who only contested seats in scotland i won t make that addition unless you approve  though oh  one more thing do we have a quote from a ukip official or ukip press release on the official reaction to the election result  or a link to an article about it  it would be interesting for readers to see what  spin  the party put on what might otherwise be regarded as quite a disappointing result for them  ,80964bc23ecd4a50,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

71856,108011,courtney here are my suggestions from my peer review of your article chunking psychology by  dan hurlburt considering the fact that this article was removed by a previous editor i just looked in the articles history and examined the latest edited form of the article before the changes were undone in order to complete my peer review the lead section provides a good stand alone summary of chunking  in psychology the article already has a strong intro that didn t require much editing in the form of adding new material  it did however  require some fine tuned modifications that i think she did a good job of locating and crossing out words and rephrasing sentences that needed to be more specific the contribution does not seem to be cut and pasted from an existing source it flows well with the article and is properly placed  the terms used go along with the articles style well and are easy to understand one sentence that sounds a little confusing when read is runners may chunk the numbers into different relevant mile  or other distances  times  may need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across in the short term memory section the sentence the short term memory processes  stores  information for about twenty to thirty seconds i think needs a word or two added in  in order to complete the thought  i tried to include a suggestion  may need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across she relates to her references where it seems necessary even though the article already includes a decent amount of information she finds the areas that did need further elaboration and creates an appropriate section for the information grammar and verb tenses and spelling all match up well with the rest of the article one area where a wiki link may help the article is in the section where she is talking about short term memory  possible link to short term memory but i don t think that it is necessary  since she does explain it a little using a reference her references match up well with the rest of the ones listed in the document in format and when investigating them  they all are relevant to the subject matter and provide useful information for the article i don t think that any images would enhance the article  considering the article already provides a good diagram that is explained well and fits the topic nicely ,415f2773195d7ac6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

50685,157846, there should be some priomordial quality mandate wikipedia should want quality verifiable references if  wp ver  is intended to be weaponized then a bot could be made that deletes pages and sections based on whether the section contains an insufficiently prestigious reference treating wp ver as an intentional algorithm would allow an attacker to delete perhaps as high as of wikipedia without even needing to look at the content no one could invoke any objection to the mass deletion if the literal interpretation of wp ver is the most important rule on wikipedia vandalism becomes impossible if criteria for removal applied to a science page can be robotically applied to a philosophy page the above attack would meet a common sense interpretation of vandalism the only possible protection from the mass deletion attack is if  wp van  is considered to have higher priority for literal interpretation than wp ver there should already be a common sense acceptance that vandalism is more dangerous and objectively assessed than the quality of referenced material  and as shown above  rejecting the statement binds wikipedia to a suicide pact its my view that the recent deletions are indistinguishable from robotic vandalism and they deleted high quality and verifiable references based only on the content hosting platform if vandalism and verifiability are to be equally considered in actions  then restoring the content and tagging it as needing better sources should be done also if there is to be a defense from robotic deletion of the majority of wikipedia  then deletors that have shown no previous contribution to the page should be treated more suspiciously than those who have helped build it  ,e47b116713992fbe,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

51935,152025, trusilver  mediation  et al you can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish  i m not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp s admin shopping on wp aiv finally paid off  while  obviously  i m happy to accept any attempt to produce a better us mobile phone companies template  i have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject my first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article s discussion page  at this stage  the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them  a discussion requires that you express your reasons why  and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views  is jdchamp  a better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the talk  page of the appropriate article  i have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks  and given my reasons for my beliefs  i have done also said that i believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp  and to trusilver  the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there  unfortunately  he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk  page  varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me  to expressing a willingness to discuss the article  yet  for some reason  not followed by actual action on his part  mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that s based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion  while that different of opinion might exist at this point  unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully  as in  gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments there has been no discussion  and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature my second concern  and believe me i m not happy in saying this  is that i have concerns about trusilver as the mediator  please do not take anything i say about this as assuming bad faith  i m absolutely sure trusilver thinks what he s done is right  but that said  i don t trust his judgment on this issue  based upon an on going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp  trusilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp s on going campaign  in particular trusilver has accused me of using his talk  page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp  this is untrue  i have only ever posted once to trusilver s talk  page  posting an apology for the fact he d been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it  after it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time  and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind  i made the decision to not post there again  trusilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp s differences with me  these differences concerning the mobile phone companies template  this is also manifestly untrue  i have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page s talk  page  even participating in a poll that i believe was posted prematurely  arguing why i believe what i do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties  i have removed jdchamp s vandalism of my page  which in some cases involved posting claims that he was willing to discuss various issues  but were neither posted in the correct place  nor actual discussions of those issues  trusilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me  accusing me of being dysfunctional  and of disruptiveness  edit warring  and incivility  with the possible exception of my  pretty justified  expression of frustration last night  nothing i ve done of late fits the latter category  and the nearest thing i ve done that comes to edit warring consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp  the other comments are just plain insulting and wrong i ve suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last days  i asked for help  and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me  other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam wp aiv with inappropriate demands i be  block nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior  and as he showed last night with three warnings  and multiple reverts on my talk  page  his behavior remains as bad as ever while i m sure trusilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him  i don t believe he h,86b19218246018b0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

26731,109453, hi  i ll also post this on  page firstly  catgut  i welcome your comments and hope you always feel free to offer them  i think that this list is always going to be subjective  and only open discussion is going to provide the best result  i think wildhartlivie makes a very valid point in addressing the limitations and key audience of this project  which is the english speaking world  going back to the definition criteria for inclusion  core topics about actors and filmmakers  generally  these are people who are extremely notable to the common person  this category should stay limited to approximately members i think is just an arbitrary number  and i think we should agree that it should be viewed as a guide rather than a rule  the most important point is extremely notable to the common person and in this project the common person is someone who predominently speaks english  and it would follow that the interests and backgrounds of the great majority of these people would be related to the culture of english speaking countries in w hate ver field they happen to be looking  whether it s music  literature or cinema  i would expect that the average chinese cinema goer would be unfamiliar with almost every name on the current list  but if you were to go to chinese wikipedia you would rightly see that their articles are skewed with a chinese perspective  i don t think that adding names that are best known within their own non english language industries would balance this list  i think it would actually unbalance it by adding a number of names that are unfamiliar to the people who most often use these pages  and whose culture is supposed to be reflected in the ratings given  someone such as sharukh khan  to choose one name at random  is undeniably a significant figure but from the point of view of english language wikipedia  and the english language experience of most of its readers  would have much less relevance i agree that this requires further discussion  and certainly individual names should be discussed  but i think to provide a completely balanced world view would be beyond the scope of this project i would also like to echo another of wildhartlivie s comments  one of the main results of tagging these articles should be that they are spotlighted by the community at large  as articles that merit elevation to good or featured standard it s saying these articles need to be fixed first rather than these individuals made more startling contributions to world cinema than anyone else although notability and influence are crucial to identifying the subjects  ,4960498bf17867ee,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

24529,50296, fresh start  alright  neil  let s try from the beginning again  hopefully with a better result this time  the genseiry karate do international federation article is clearly being vandalized by mario roering as he removes links and references from the article with false reasoning  example here the link clearly shows  that the book exist  and who the author is  here mario roering removes yet another reference  even though the reference clearly states  that this is the first book ever here mario roering ads a link to a taido site  with an essay on the history of taido  not genseiryu thus irrelevant on the issue of genseiryu  this reference has some correct dates  some correct information  but is at best only a collection of information found on the internet from various other sources and is as well full of equally incorrect information  mario roering does not cite any phrase of the essay  and he does not provide any reasons for why this reference should be better than the one already included  thus this is not a researched essay or document  also taido is siding with the wgkf and supporting them as can be seen on many pictures  and even the agreement of the establishment of the wgkf  at best  this reference is a none supported  none factual and partial essay  and like it says  it is an essay on taido  not genseiryu  as a third party reference this is not valid  many of the things mario roering has disputed in the great many earlier edits  is among others  that kunihiko tosa  president of the gkif  was not the first student of the founder seiken shukumine  but in this essay it says that he started taking lessons from the founder in one year prior to the establishment of genseiryu in the essays mentions that kunihiko tosa published a  some  book on genseiryu  which is i guess the reason for mario roering to include this source using this argument as a counterargument to my source and claim  is the same as leaving it up to me to proof a negative  that kunihiko tosa wrote and published a book on genseiryu in is confirmed in the essay as well as other sources included by me  but it does not say that the book is the first ever on genseiryu  as i mentioned above  this is like saying that when something is not mentioned  it is not so  which of course cannot be laid down as fact or support for removing my claim as this book being the first ever on genseiryu  another point is  that if mario roering wants to include this essay as a valid reference  he must accept all the postulates in the essay  also the ones that he has disputed many times before  but  well  i guess that will not happen  thus this reference should be discarded  as it is not trustworthy as a reference  but merely a collection of information found on the internet  the author is not named  could not find it anyway  and the sources used in this essay are not listed  here mario roering deletes a valuable link to a reference part of kunihiko tosa s book written in in this book  the founder of genseiryu  seiken shukumine  wrote a preface and he co authored the book as a technical advisor  as well as he himself recognized this book as being genseiryu  the reference is thus a valid one  but it is my opinion  that mario roering wants this left out  simply because this contradicts his own views and his perception of what is the true genseiryu  in mario roering s world  he would feel a lot better  if this book and the preface by the founder would simply go away  like go back in a time machine and make sure it was never published  mario roering has claimed on more than one occasion  that we  the gkif  are not doing genseiryu  but only that the wgkf is  this book clearly shows  that the founder approved and supported kunihiko tosa as genseiryu  thus the contradictions clearly stands out  it is obvious  that mario roering wants it left out  simply because it shows that his claims are untrue and impossible to proof  and that it is thus easier to simply get this claim removed  here mario roering wants to provoke me by asking for citation  it is obvious  that this information originates from an interview i had with the author kunihiko tosa  the information has been put there t,867423026dc63324,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

29943,135052, i see your point  but i think the difference is that we aren t talking about  trans lations and romanizations  that is what we are using already  romanizations for example vegeta instead of bejita or vejita  noone s using unnofficial romanizations  or straight romaji or kanji  which is why i get riled up when i see the use english argument  so i hope i didnt come off as contentious  it s just that i think people misuse the word  trans lation  i dunno if you saw the old mr  satan hercule argument  points on commonality were certainly worth discussing  but a number of the more vocal people were insisting that mr  satan was a japanese phrase and hercule it s  trans lation  that isn t what  trans lation is  the thing is  and i think a lot of people forget  is that english language wiki is a language choice  not a subset of countries that we are allowed to write articles about  english wiki is worldwide  like every other wiki  most other wikis get this too  look at the french wiki  the french dub named piccolo as satan  kami being god of earth  they figured his evil counterpart would be the devil  and then changed mr  satan to hercule  that s where the name comes from but the articles their were on piccolo and mr  satan  making note that when adapted into french the names satan and hercule were used  on attacks  those are likely going to be restructered soon anyway  as for why in most cases we used names from the daizenshuu attack list  it is because that is the only comprehensive list that exists  i have tried  really hard  to work such a list based on the dub and even viz manga  you can t  the manga doesn t cover every aspect of the series and misses some attacks  and viz is weird with attacks  keeps some the same  half  trans lates some trans lates some into chinese the dub has some that are the same or  trans lations  some with names invented for the dub  some attacks misnamed as other existing attacks  some attacks with multiple names  and some attacks without names at all  for example  piccolo s old signature move that you see in games more often now was the bakurikimaha  you saw it when he attacked raditz on the cliff  gohan s first signature was the masenko  according to the dub these two distinct techniques are the same move and called masenko ha  goku s last ditch move is the genki dama and yamch ass ignature ki attack is the sokidan  according to the dub they were both spirit bomb  and the sokidan has also been renamed spirit ball  tenshinhan s signature kikoho has been called between dub  manga  and games the tri beam  blast cannon  ki blast cannon  and chi kung blast  it just gets confusing trying to keep track  and then there are moves that don t get named  like freeza s death ball pr the big bang attack  they get named as such now because of video games  which are  trans lated from japanese  which goes by the daizenshuu list  so any attack that doesn t have a dub rename tends to be some form or  trans lation of the original name  since no dub equivolent exists for them i really hoped that makes sense  its like in the morning here  so if it didn t let me know and i ll clarify  ,d263ce44390c3853,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

57674,104111, you think what i said constituted a threat and regardless of its merit it created a hostile editing environment you think it violated some policy i am not aware of regarding off wiki drafts or some such i m going to stop there if as i have already clarified  the ga criteria indicate that those articles should be either improved to bring them up to legitimate ga status  or reassessed  curtisnaito s track record of ownership and edit warring indicates that the former is impossible  leaving the latter option  reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy  and i wasn t actually threatening to do so anyway  i was threatening not to do so  in my two years of arguing with curtisnaito  i have in all but one occasion  the emperor jimmu article  chosen the carrot over the stick if you should express that opinion in an appropriate forum like an article talk page or the currently open history of japan gar  blocking one side of a content dispute because you happen to agree with the other is inappropriate  especially when the other side has explicitly violated an ani final warning numerous times over the past two weeks note that i don t actually think this is why you  block  me  i m grabbing at straws  sorry  just noticed this  if you may be right  but look what i have had to deal with  curtisnaito has requested four times in the last five months  on both ani and arbcom  that i be site banned for disagreeing with his edits  even though pretty much everyone else disagrees with them too  if there s a hostile editing environment  i m not the one to blame  and as in above  it was not a threat anyway  i was offering a favour in exchange for curtisnaito granting me the favour of not requesting that i be site banned anymore  if this is what you meant  it s a good faith misunderstanding  and i will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future  but i should still be un block if tell me the policy  i won t violate it again  i also won t appeal the block  though  since i ve been here too long for ignorance of the rules to be a valid excuse  ,2d20fdfb92c94379,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49949,44952, the problem is even the statement jesus is fictional has a large range going from the jesus of the gospels is a fiction to jesus is an entire fiction take sherlock holmes for example while holmes is a fictional character he is based on a mixture of dr joseph bell and sir arthur conan doyle two people who undoubtedly lived and there have been several books and tv programs over the years presenting one or the other as the real sherlock holmes  similarly  we know that even in paul s there were other gospels galatians and by the time irenaeus wrote his against heresies  c ce  the number of gospels had definitely increased the fact that irenaeus stated that the thirty ons are not typified by the fact that christ was baptized in his thirtieth year  he did not suffer in the twelfth month after his baptism  but was more than fifty years old when he died  book ii  chapter is one joseph wheless uses with nearly suppressed glee later on going as far as to say in the work often cited  bishop irenaeus either falsely quotes the gospel of mark  or the sacred text has been seriously altered in our present copies regarding some other point while wheless  ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points if as the pro historical jesus camp state that jesus was born c  bce and died c ce  a space of only years  then how could irenaeus expressly state jesus lived at least years longer than this span and that view was as the gospel and all the elders testify one does not need to be a scholar to realize something clearly is messed up somewhere  ,782d4e4537477a61,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

38039,23992, november utc my apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above  i have re read it and can still find none  you argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study while i believe that the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead that looks like agreement to me  where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a euclidean mathematical definition  while i do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead  as to the actual content  the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches  what emerged should not be treated lightly  or substantially edited without prior agreement  i am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal  and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus  i did restore a little of what you wrote  but in the mean time let us not play ping pong with the page itself  on the matter of references  regular polytopes and convex polytopes are widely read works which can hardly be described as specialised  they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied  some others which i referenced are original sources which  out of respect to you as a professional mathematician  i would not pull away from drawing to your attention  others do move beyond a euclidean treatment  and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph  more directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a star polygon recognised as such since the days of archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave  which is more formally understood as a simple polygon while mathematicians such as gr  nbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as simple or convex in treatments of these objects  gr  nbaum explicitly  yourself implicitly a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury  the article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person s preconceptions  whereby polygons may be divided into those which self intersect and those which do not  with that proviso  if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead  i would hope you can share them with us  first  cheers  talk ,3f5f7eac12fd519a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

4237,92734,  however  you could use the same argument to delete almost everything in the article because many encyclopedias include a description of jimmu so short it doesn t even cover things like the origins of his name and title and the issue of his historicity  in regards to the consensus of wikipedia editors  and i m not referring to flying tiger  when nishidani proposed that in the long run we discuss all aspects of jimmu s memory from start to finish  including medieval and tokugawa times  historiography  and popular culture  most users who commented agreed with that even though it s safe to say that no encyclopedias cover these last three things  it s certain that people in japan made a clear link between hakko ichiu and jimmu and if you had done a less restrictive book search  you would still have found no fewer than english language sources noting this connection  including the reliable sources this article cites like edwards  dower  earhart  ruoff  and brownlee  for instance  emperor hirohito evidently referred to jimmu when he said it has been the great instruction bequeathed by our imperial foundress  the sun goddess  and other imperial ancestors that our grand moral obligation should be extended to all directions and the world be unified under one roof  as historian james mcclain notes as every japanese schoolchild who had read kokutai no hongi knew by heart  hakko ichiu meant  eight cords  one roof  and first appeared in the eighth century chronicle nihon shoki  the association between jimmu and hakko ichiu was extensively cultivated in wartime japan  most scholars are aware of that  and it is highly relevant for wikipedia purposes  concerning our four sentences on hakko ichiu  for now i d say we can shorten it to three if necessary  possibly deleting the sentence cited to bix  but otherwise i see no reason or consensus to trim it back further than that  frankly  as the article gradually expands there is even more that can be eventually noted here such as perhaps uchiteshi yamamu  the other wartime phrase attributed to jimmu  or possibly okawa shumei s establishment of the jimmu society  the resurrection of the jimmu propaganda machine in modern times does not need to be downplayed for fear of completely ignorant anti japanese pov pushers actually  i think we should try to contact flying tiger and let him speak here if we re going to keep on talking about him in those kind of terms  ,f7f75faf17727663,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

16589,4964, and use the confusing  redundent  yet common phrase north america not refering to the continent  either of two reasons  a desire to place the united states last on the list  by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the fair use of alphabetization to make the us hard to find  simply an oversight  well  nobody replied so i renamed the section on territories and regions to u n  subregions  it s amazing that this list puts the united states last  even though it has most of the people and of the area  is someone trying to de emphasize america s importance no it s just in alphabetical order  talk about  any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively canada and the united states yes  in the  human geography  section  namely the  rd paragraph other related terms are also treated in that sxn  talk central americans are not north americans  we are own people and we are not northerners we are seperate from them and are nothing like them  you can try to correct me  but the people who say that we are north americans are white folk who try to keep us down  and sometimes other ignorant groups of people i will never surrender to being north american and nor should any other central american should ever buy into this i don t care what the white man tells us they re not us we should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be this is just another way of bringing us down i am proud of being central american and being someone who inhabited this land long before the white people made contact with us if we have been living here for the longest time  should it not be us who decides who we want to be  tito a  mart  nez this is a lovely essay  but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling central america happens to be located in north america  so central americans are north americans it s a geographical thing  not a cultural thing  perhaps you re thinking of latin america and anglo america actually  tito can undeclare himself if you ll check the spanish wikipedia articles on central america and north america  you will see that spanish language defines north americ ass outhern most country as mexico  es norteam  rica redirects to es am  rica del norte  which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order  greenland canada united states mexico note that central america is not on this list wilyd is also right  as far as english language goes  north america includes mexico and central america  i think america  terminology  should provide a better explanation than it currently does  a section on english vs  spanish terminology would help i don t speak spanish  but i studied french in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning  maybe i ll recruit some bilingual wikipedians to help me write this okay  but i ll claim the fatal flaw here is this am  rica del norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term north america tito may not be a norteamericano although i don t think he declares himself here either doesn t spanish have an equivilent to l academie but he s still north american  actually  i don t think north american is an identity that applies to latin americans  his country  if it s in central america  is a part of the north american continent  but the cultural division is what he s concerned about  want to help me update america  terminology i think america  terminology  reflects correct english usage maybe use of the word american is a better place to move these kind of complaints  although i m actively involved in that article  and know it ll get shot down as original research roughly speaking  there aren t political continents wikipedia has articles on anglo america  not that i m convinced the term exists  in contrast,0d22096912a1c17e,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

32139,55637, is a matter of people editing your contributions  otherwise  why would you edit war in order to include content that violates the rules  more particularly about or  and that happens to be written by you a lot of or has already been removed many times from many articles by many editors  including me  however you created conflicts only when your contributions were concerned  because you just cannot accept the idea that your holy edits wouldn t stay on wp i m not reverting any change made by anyone i am removing content that has nothing to do on wikipedia  such as unsourced opinions and original research  each time i m removing something  it is always perfectly justified according to the wp policies and guidelines  however  each time you start an edit war  you re just unable to find anything to substanciate it  other than personal attacks  by the way  contributing to an article in any way  either by actually writing quality content  ie content that meet the requirements from various policies  or by removing the content that doesn t correspond to the wp standards  is work  so yes  i have worked on eva articles so  you are the hothead who throws childish trantrums each time someone dares to touch your holy writings  and who yell at me instead of trying to discuss with civility and to actually try to justify your edits concerning your nonesense about authority as dandy sephy reminded you  consensus isn t require to write things  and things being changed is what wikipedia is about moreover  there is no need of consensus to remove obvious policy violations either  such as original research  unsourced opinions  etc  that is  everything i have removed from your contribs on the contrary  as it is stated in wp v  any material lacking a reliable source may be removed i know very well what the next part of the sentence recommands  but it only highlights the fact that there is no need of discussion  only that the editor wanting to re include the content has the duty to find a source  and not endlessly argue that editors should be allowed to write unsourced or  there is also the jimmy wales quote i can not emphasize this enough  there seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative  i heard it somewhere  pseudo information is to be tagged with a  needs a cite  tag  wrong  it should be removed  aggressively  unless it can be sourced  so if you re not ready to accept that anyone can remove your edits  you should not contribute  what you re saying is indeed utter nonesense  nowhere in wp is it stated that i would need your approval before removing your contribs  whether i d just be wanting to replace them with something entirely different  or they d be blatant policy violations and indeed wikipedia is not going to tolerate policy violations just so that some contributors could maintain their grasps on articles and their pride  when i remove content  it is always according to the most basic rules of wp so there s no discussing it  it is not authority  it is applying the rules of wp  and i can t see why they wouldn t apply to you  by the way  you re reproaching me a so called authority but it doesn t seem to bother you to reinsert your content back into the article without any discussion of without any justification concerning the various policies and guidelines  you should not give lessons about authority in these circumstances  in conclusion  your multiple and failed attempts at article ownership have only slowed down improvements  as your silly argument is doing now  you d better either start showing you can write the actual quality content that you re boasting about  or stop whining  so everything you re saying is utter nonesense it  ,94a3474b210bb658,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

23309,158126, expanding sections hello  i was wondering if there were some users out there that could maybe assist with the expansion of this kingdom hearts article  i ve been spending the past week trying to cite and expand sections as best i can  but i ve run into a few walls that i was hoping others might be able to help with the development section is missing information on any actual development of the game itself  there s some info in the kingdom hearts  series  development section  but it isn t cited  if anyone can find some developer interviews about the game that could be sourced  that would help expand that section the manga section is missing information on the japanese publication serialization there are a few statements that i tagged as citation needed that i wasn t able to find any sources for  admittedly  i wasn t specifically looking for those information  but nothing came up in my general searches i m currently trying to find the proper in game dialog to cite some of the information in the setting and story sections  if any body would like to help  it would be appreciated one last thing  if anybody can get information from or has the kingdom hearts ultimania  kingdom hearts ultimania revised edition  and or kingdom hearts series ultimania introduction of kingdom hearts ii that could help expand and source the development and versions and merchandise sections i ll keep trying to find information as best i can  but i m having a hard time finding the appropriate information in english  and my japanese is limited  any help would of course be appreciated  but if the list above can be addressed  i think it would greatly help in getting this article to good article status and hopefully eventually featured article status  gamefaqs has a script and journal text  i can t help you much on the other stuff  as most of the interviews i find are only relevant to the later games and aren t sourced very well  i commend you for your efforts to make a good article  thanks for the game script link  that made getting the dialog much easier than trying to  trans cribe it from videos  i tired to find appropriate citations and i feel that the general story is cited well enough  but others may disagree and add as they see fit i found a little bit of info for some things and added a reference for one item needing citation  but am still looking for the others  after looking at the kingdom hearts setting section  i think it may need a rewrite  i think the people from the peer review will say that it is too much like game guide information instead of encyclopedic material  i ll try to paraphrase the information there in a separate edit to make any reverts easier  in case other editors are unhappy with the result  great work overall  on setting i wrote that section to emulate the style of final fantasy vii s section  but i don t mind your complete rewrite  thanks for the copy edit  i wasn t too happy with the rewrite i did  it looks better now  i edited the reception section to create a table of the ratings so that way they weren t just listed one after another  if others think that it takes away from the article feel free to revert it i m thinking of doing a rewrite of the characters section  the first two paragraphs read more like gameplay information  there is also no mention of the villains  i ll do it in a separate edit again  in case it doesn t turn out well  wow  finally some work being done  thanks  guyinblack for initiating this  i ve had this article on my to fa list for some time but i never really got around to it  anyway  i think i m going to give it a thorough copyedit before adding new stuff  thanks  please do  because i keep finding grammar edits or weird sentences after some of the rewrites i ve done  i try to remember to fix them but they slip my mind  if you re looking for new content to add  there is obviously the list above  but i also think the introduction could use some expanding if the article is to make further  after you made your revisions to the article  perhaps we should send it to the peer review to see what else can be done  good plan  i just reworked the lead into three paragraphs like most fas newli,e91a4d59e99f3acc,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

116514,92090,on the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced  the homogenisation of england did not permeate beyond the tamar into the cornish peninsular until the later half of the th century  and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate cornish identity  in the rest of england the celtic identity of the britons was subsumed by the waves of anglo saxon  danish and norman invasions  but the king on the throne of england has been the cornish people s overlord for some years  even so  the cornish language aside  of which there has not been one native speaker for years i wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of yorkshire  a yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of england but very few would not claim england to be the nation of their birth in the th century a cock ney and a geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating  though they were speaking the same tongue  but both would have been sure they were living in england  england was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity  what is england and englishness anyway  is it drinking tea or eating roast beef or playing cricket  or a sense of fair play or belief in trial by jury or a particular sense of humour  if it is anyone of these i don t see how the cornish differ from the english leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear  the cornish nation ceased to exist some years ago and the duchy of cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region  it is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves english  some are not  but some scots nationalists dislike being called british  the fact remains that scotland is in britain  uk  similarly those cornish people may dislike being called english cannot get away from the fact that as it stands cornwall remains a county in england until a cornish nation is re established  despite the aspirations of cornish nationalists separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the duchy of cornwall  cornwall is currently a county in england and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous  it would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise  as for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article  as long as it continues to state that  cornwall is a county of great britain  or similar avoidance of the words  county in england new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to  county in england  because rightly or wrongly  that s what everybody apart from a small minority  and as far as wikipedia is concerned i think it s a minority of one perceive it to be sep utc ,f632c8f9eff82d84,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

15105,38206, about draft hi i like your opinion piece draft it s great in providing many quantifications of the promo commercial articles i like how you narrate your wikiproject poland experience and develop from that i like how you call for a major cleanup drive at the end  though  you ask the readers to go off separately and do a little bit towards solving the problem imo that is not enough  and you ve motivated something bigger  a big cleanup drive  but that should be a lot more  maybe you should compare your proposal to the big drive to address un referenced biographies of living people  urblp s  a problem that was recognized more and more during and then blew up in controversy in january i think it was there was one editor deleting them by the hundreds  i think  which made others mad and wikipedia was hammered in the outside news coverage about some salient bad incidents the problem was addressed by a big drive  with one element being wp urblp wikiproject s efforts that i happened to join the drive was well focused because there was a known number of unreferenced blps in a category  to be addressed although there were new ones coming in  and more old ones being discovered of course and that one editor agreed to back off  if the number was reduced by half in six months that s my very imperfect understanding of the situation before i joined  the drive i participated in worked well i tried to help keep focus on the goal  and in several other ways  but some others had far more direct impact than i did see wikipedia talk wikiproject unreferenced biographies of living persons archive goal statement every day we could see the current number  and it moving or not  and some big changes were made to reduce the number of new urblps coming in  and some other targeted efforts were tried and some clearly made a difference while others did not overall  having the big  numeric public goal that we wanted to meet  and having immediate feedback gratification in seeing the total category s number change  was key it was rewarding and frustrating and a team effort going on  etc not just a bunch of people working completely separately in the end the month goal was finally met though it was very close then i and some others dropped out but the overall problem had been somewhat solved and it s been better since  and the number was brought all the way down to effectively  and is at about now  i see  i m not saying you should talk much or at all about that urblp problem and its drive  in your opinion piece  but i think your calling for accurate measurement of the current problem  by a one month effort to get all of the problematic articles tagged  say  the same way  would be reasonable there would have to be an enforceable rule made up  that prevented the paid pr persons from deleting the tags on their articles there was something like that with the urblps i think anyone seen deleting the urblp tag was warned and  block  as disruptive if necessary and then you can call for something aggressive like bringing the real number down to tops within a year  or w hate ver your estimating the problem size to be is helpful towards setting that up or you could call for something quite different my main reaction  anyhow  was that i expected at the end for you to call for something big asking people to separately make efforts that would not even be measurable  would not be enough  imo you ve earned the right to call for a bigger more organized effort also i m not sure spam is the right title you do clarify you don t mean external links spamming  but that s what i think of what is the right name for this problem you have the opportunity to name it  maybe  perhaps some acronym business puff pieces by paid editors probably bppbpep nope the problem is talked about at talk jimbo wales and elsewhere  though  and there may be a good name for it already hope this helps my two or three cents i ll get to the other thing i owe  but probably not until the weekend or next week ncram  ,65f8ec8b8a419f3e,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

43963,84132, response to earlier morality accusation  this is inresponse to a cowardly unsigned who suggested that thomas alva was a pedophile  the entire section was deleted  i think the response is worth keeping as it delves into the intrigue in edison s life  isn t the u s  age of consent as unsigned stated hey idiot this was the nineteenth century  thoughout the western world  females marrying at the age of were common  never raising as much as an eyebrow from the emerging victoian era  actually  a young girl marrying a man who was middle aged and still in the prime of life was applauded and encouraged  as well as her parents for matching her with any man who had established means  what was frowned upon at that time  and still very much today  was if the man were eighteen to her  say sixteen  or both were the same teen age  though today  as was true then  a parent could get a waiver  and consent to the union a young marriage was mightily discouraged by society and the girl s parents in that bygone era  as they saw young love as impetuous  irrational  and especially immature  unless the man was shown to be of more than sufficient means  maturity and responsibility  that he came from a respected family  the whole idea was nixed  also  remember that arranged marriages were still quite common in turn of the century america and too  fathers were eager to get their daughters married off as soon as possible  so they wouldn t get radical ideas of independence floating in their heads not like the mail order brides of the rambling old west actually  would it surprise you that arranged unions are still widely carried out today accross every interested section and spectrum of society in the west  it s just more informal  as the female especially is tasked by parents and relatives to choose a mate within the liking of the parents  and often times  relatives  gotta please mom and dad  my grandparents and priest  ya know you should also study more about edison s life before making moronic and scurrilous accusations  if you did delve further  you would find that edison s second marriage was more a politcal arrangement than anything else  as little mina was a neice of thomas alva s principal enemy and competitor jupiter pierpont morgan  struggling as the latter was to keep his floundering gas light industry afloat against the inevitability of the electric street lamp  so  the marrige was a very strategically diabolic investment on morgan s part to overtake edison  business  which eventually happened we are reminded that morgan a a robber baron  this is what they do  it is strange that you d call alva edison a pedophile  why  unless you seek to marr his reputation talk veryverser  following this clarification  perhaps it was the article s author who attempted to resolve this by offering the results of his genelogical study of what was conventional in such relationships in that period that edison lived  this i felt was inadequate  so i countered with  we are talking social conventions here  of course  naturally long before the sa d  women s liberation all females needed their parents or guardian s  s consent  whether they were co habitating with them  or the women were apart from them and or had indepenent means  this was common all over the world  with this tradition being broken  beginingin in north america by enforced emigration for example of irish and other european refugees in the nineteenth  and then again in the early twentieth centuries  even women who were twenty one years old in the turn of the nineteenth  and early twentieth century s middle class strata were required to seek a respectable  well heeled sponsor  to give consent to a bethrotal if these females ever were to hope to enter what was then regarded as respectable society this all seemed to chagge in america after world war i  as there seemed to have been a definite cultural shift throwing off those old traditions of a previous generation and epoch  edison s age difference is a non issue  even in most parts of asia and europe today  age in a marriage of an older man to a  well  sometimes much  younger woman is revered  here  in the states  various wealthly and powerful men  among them old hollywood and media types flaunt their marriage to virtual child brides woody allen  rupert murdock as obvious examples  curious wouldn t you agree that in both cases cited  these men chose young  oriental women  rather than western ones for their sunset years in alva edison s case  this was sort of a wirlwind romance manipulated by the girl s uncle  as i cited above  to get at edison and control of his company  think napolean bonafart s divorce of josephine to marry a hapsburgh princess  and the world shattering events that ensued from such a political union  special contr,e117882af82faa43,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

24197,77419, firstly  please  i ll appreciate if you will use colons to format your responce properly  in the same way i ve done for you that makes the thread more readable  gonna quote your ansewers  just don t edit my posts  i don t like this  re ija offensive  yes  i think the ussr had no chances against the whole axis in the case if britain and the us never existed  however  in this case the axis would never formed hitler  was very suspicious of japan  and there would be no germano japanese alliance  i think it would be really difficult  still it cannot be said it would be impossible  i m not saying that confractuations are facts  my goal is try keep this whole thing in the confractuation zone  therefore mather of personal opinion only  you that are trying to put confractuations as facts and the use of britain and the us never existed was too much in my view  they could simple have remained neutral while the axis fought against the soviets  regarding the japanese decision not to attack the ussr  in dec and dec they did plan to do so in the case of major soviet defeats under moscow or stalingrad  however  that hadn t happen  and the role of the western allies was minimal in that  in addition  as some scholars believe  the khalkhin gol  nomonhan  lesson was duly learnt by the ija staff  minimal  stalin loved the oil embargo that roosevelt put in japan  it could have been this very factor that saved his neck  the japanese were a military government  and both the army and navy did put pressure for their attacks  the attack in the in the pacific was purely desesperation  if roosevelt didn t mather with the soviets  it was just question to give the japanese their oil and good will to put them against stalin  however at this time the us was already allied with the soviet cause  and i don t remember were i read now  but the us embassador even treath the japanese embassador in a conversation if they launched an attack against the ussr about nomonhan  the ija staff learned some serious lessons on how to fight the soviets with it  the army never give up of the idea of attack the ussr  even the navy had some simpaty for the cause if it s advance in the pacific would not be halted  war between the two countries was probably inevitable  get rid of the communist treat was one of the largest security problems for japan  matsuok ass ecretary comments this in the world at war banzai episodie  he said but when an integration against the north parted  oil  the army naturally joined up with the navy obviosly  only for maintein the war in china and could fight the soviets in the future because the critical resources needed battle of the bulge please  clarify why you don t see the aspects of the battle from the allied side why the soviets can loose like they did in barbarossa and this be extremely analized by hypocrital intelectuals like you and the causes of one supossed less than expected performance the western allies not be battles are won by several factors  anacronism is not nice here  the western allies win in the bulge  the soviet sucess in bagration for instance  was not garanteed when it was launched  it could had end up much worse than in the bulge  with even defeat re lend lease yes  the soviets could produce everything they needed  look the link i posted above  the importance of the lend lease is well illustrated  also  no lend lease  less material produced  more casualities for the soviet side  they would resist this and the combined offensive of all the axis powers  pehaps  isn t  i m just trying to point all this is something of impossible complexity  and therefore should be let in the field of personal opinions  that means about german tanks were not built and what crew was supposed to drive these tanks  germany had a desperate situation with personnel  due to the eastern front perhaps they wouldn t have if they could master their forces there from the start  also the money and the time spent with the subs could be used to solve many other problems  produced even more refined weapons  and this includes weapons of mass destruction  i m here to fight with you as long as i can  but one thing you already admit  you don t belive the ussr could hold all the axis countries together  repeating  i said this would be much difficult  but not impossible  just don t want confractuations as truth  wars are like plane crash investigation  it s usually not one or the big factor  but several of them together  ,cf6a472c193f4b45,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

122089,121852,questions over status  as already mentioned above the legal status of this constabulary is a grey area i am a serving officer in the met and many of my colleagues are unaware of the powers and remit of borough constabularies such as the wpp if serving front line police officers are unsure  then i have to say there is a definite grey area for the public i have done some research and discovered some interesting points which the article does not in its present form represent as a result  i and it would appear an anon editor have edited the article to try and make a better and objective article which reflects reality as it was  the article was subjective and questionable however these edits have been reverted without explanation apart from comments such as this is the truth in effort to explain my edits and prevent an edit war i set out below my reason for altering the article  london borough parks constabularies are  as is correctly quoted  established under sec of the ministry of housing and local government provision order confirmation this act allows london borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parks bye laws in their respective parks it does not make these constables police constables and does not allow police services or forces to be established no police powers are given to these parks constables  with the exception of parks bye laws  over and above those which everybody is entitled  often referred to as any person powers or as in the case of arrest  citizen s arrest in comparison  officers from home office forces  such as the met  kent police etc  can point to the police act as the basis for their establishment  jurisdiction and powers as police constables btp officers can point to the railways and  trans port safety act ministry of defence police officer can point to the ministry of defence police act i could go on my point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services forces the wpp does not  unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that i have missed so the article started by saying  wandsworth parks police is a police service successfully run two points about the opening sentence firstly  its not legally a police service but a borough parks constabulary secondly  the comment regarding successfully run is highly subjective and without basis all organisations would like to be thought of a successful  but without any citation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the met and working closely with it irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parks constabulary this paragraph should merely be about the legal status of wpp and its constables the paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears wpp constables in  but not as police constables but as parks constables due to the legislation involved once sworn in the parks constables have executive powers to enforce parks bye laws in their boroughs only criminal law is not included however  just like the general public  parks constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only this is commonly known as citizens arrest due to changes in arrest powers with socap in non police officers  such as parks constables need to be aware of the necessity criteria to make an arrest lawful my point is that the article read like the parks constables had police powers they don t  apart from the bye law aspect the paragraph then goes on to state that parks constables come under pace well this is obvious and irrelevant  any arrest by anyone is under pace  as amended by socap what it doesn t do is give parks constables any more power than joe public  apart from the bye law aspect for all the above reasons  the last sentence of this paragraph they are always parks police officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye laws  is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading there is no such thing as a parks police officer i had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parks constabularies and their use of the word police blue lights and use of batons etc these were deleted without reason they are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area you may not agree with the report and committee s results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there is a grey area and wpp are treading on thin ice on occasion  newli,8be68fd70df96705,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

139632,83744,the solution without a reference y  n  m n  never produces an output  the algorithm always produces a m  result when the answer is yes from the oracle queried  and never produces a result when the answer is n  even to the other possible phrasings of the same query  it is striking how easy it is to miss the ingenuity of our programmers here  most of the solution was already present as much as the pioneers and experts in the field surmised and asserted possible  particularly  the comment on fermat s last theorem is relevantly applicable  such deep theories are in many instances required to solve largely thought unsolvable problems  especially in cases when most of the solution and the proof in the word was already known to the experts in the field the algorithm answers yes with m  when the output produced from a correctly asked question produces never a no written as n result  but only a yes result  incorrectly stated questions are they that cannot be resolved because they result in a n or no output never producing m by the computer given an incorrectly asked question  given a correctly asked question  the computer will always return a m output eventually  but given the complexity of the question and the known variables the time required to solve an np complete problem depends entirely on the specific incidence and construction of this algorithm  to illustrate the functions here is a clear example question correctly asked does the remote control not need new batteries algorithm says check the button function  if it changes the channel on the tv or the volume of the tv the computer monitoring the remote control produces a m result  the conclusion is output  yes means no incorrectly asked question seeking an np complete problem does the remote control have new batteries if the check of the remote control does reveal a failure of the button to change the channel or volume of the tv the answer is the conclusion is never output because this would be a no or n response i jesus  leave it as a proof to all life  it is not the most elegantly stated  so please forgive my not being more concise  but the solution is air tight  i promise you  children ,e01faa91323774c7,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

27116,40768, history fyi galen  a physician in second century rome  dissected pigs and goats  and is known as the father of vivisection this claim comes from a section on the lpag site that says then  during second century rome  a physician named galen began to dissect animals because church protocol did not allow human autopsies  he began to dissect goats and pigs and compared his findings to what he knew about humans  he is now known as the father of vivisection following this citation back  it comes from greek cr  greek js sacred cows and golden geese  the continuum international publishing group  inc new york  new york which  in turn  is based on a passage from hans ruesch s slaughter of the innocent from and galen worked as a doctor to gladiators at pergamum  this was around the time that christians were being persecuted by roman authorities and used as dispoable items in the games  galen undoubtedly had opportunity to examine many ripped and torn human bodies  and there is no reason to imagine that he would not have been allowed to fiddle about on dying christians  though i ve come across no records that he did  church protocol  in this referenced passage is a claim not supported by the historical setting here s a statement from another website vivisection originated in second century rome when galen  physician to gladiators  was prevented from continuing his dissections of human cadavers by the church led moral opposition  he switched his attention to goats and monkeys instead and thus became the  father of vivisection http w allaboutanimals org uk pt testing asp  and another in second century rome  the state supported church frowned upon the co called desecration of human corpses and autopsies were outlawed  with no human bodies to learn from  the respected physician to the gladiators  galen  had little choice but to cut up pigs and other animals  hence earning him the title  father of vivisection  http w ark ii com campaigns this is a widespread claim  undermined when it is realized that christians had no standing in the roman empire during galen s time  what is very likely is that galen learned things about human physiology from seeing so many people ripped apart  stabbed  clubbed  mauled  and otherwise opened to inspection  he probably sought to test his conjectures about what all this exposed tissue actualy did by dissecting living animals  at a tme when no real pain relief was available  a person in his position must have grown innured to seeing others  agony  this would have made his animal victims  cries unremarkable to him a more believable source observes under nero in the  st century ad  even the torture of christians became a star attraction at the circus caligulas  there were few protests against such marketable massacres  http w iridescent publishing com rtm ch p  htm  just another example of the way that questionable claims become fact in today s virtual world  becareful about what you read and cite  ,6ccd009010d3c063,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

54674,80208, well if you want to sincerely discuss it i can make an exception as i have the expertise and have some time so i ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline  the aurobindo letter begins all these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another  apart from some experiences of a personal character  the rest are either idea truths  such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being  or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which  when one is directly open to these worlds  rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment  these things  when they pour down or come in  present themselves with a great force  a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination  much sensation of light and joy  an impression of widening and power  the sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits  projected into a wonderful new world of experience  filled and enlarged and exalted  what comes associates itself  besides  with his aspirations  ambitions  notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi  it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment  in short they are talking about planes of consciousness  basically astral and mental planes  which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms  ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences  archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium  a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why kazlev popularized the concept this becomes clearer once you read the full text of paul brunton s chapter on the intermediate zone here  http paulbrunton org notebooks brunton s beginning point is that the pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage  why  several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this  between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature  it has been called the astral plane  the intermediate zone  the hall of illusion  and so on  the early efforts of all aspirants in concentration  meditation  self conquest  and study  bring them into this region  but once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked  their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid  their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained  the consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity  superstitious credulity  emotions run riot  and imagination gone wild  the safeguards against all this are first  submission to the philosophic discipline and second  submission to competent guidance  i appreciate that you have more of a buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use hindu based concepts  in this case to say that the iz is similar to a buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues  psychological wounds  and unfinished developmental tasks is sufficiently related to the iz concepts of aurobindo and brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them  is to miss the import of the iz concept  you would be familiar with the buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being  a more buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including mara to truly get through the iz  and free of the wheel and it is too dangerous without a proper guide  while buddha  or for that matter any enlightened being  is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel  the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused  even highly practiced  relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the iz  the spiritual bypass is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the iz  so i think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms  i hope you take the time to thoroughly review aurobindo and brunton s full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead  i have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case  all i ask is that editors be thorough and give some weight to those with expertise on a specific topic  ,d69e45c062116cce,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49364,64528, the ethiopian birr model you suggested to use this model in some cases  in my opinion  it is okay to include a territory in the current part succession box that has some autonomous rights  especially the right to have its own currency  like pre montenegro or present day kosovo therefore  in the case of ethiopian birr  it makes sense to speak about currency of eritrea between and between between only ethiopian administration existed  eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights saying in that the currency of eritrea is the birr is like saying in that the currency of east germany is the euro the same case of austria between even ukraine and belarus represents the same situation during their soviet union membership however  both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the un since i have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in europe during the xxth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes  for example  after wwii  slovakia got back not only its southern territories  which the  st vienna award awarded to hungary in but three villages near to pozsony bratislava  horv  tj  rfalu jarovce  oroszv  r rusovce  dunacs  ny cunovo  were awarded to slovakia  treaty of paris  due to strategic considerations  one could say that who cares with three villages  but this territory was part of hungary between the two world wars and it is not much smaller than murak  z  medimurje so i don t think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box  only mention if the currency of a new country state autonomous province etc so a state like subject that has the right to circulate its own currency  appears without precedessor  like eritrean nakfa after split from ethiopia in but unlike ethiopian birr after split of eritrea  or disappears without successor  like east german mark after the reunificaton of germany in but unlike west german mark after the reunification for example  german mark or deutschmark was the currency of the federal republic of germany between it would express that east germany was simply integrated into west germany  contrary to the widely used reunification term at least from the point of view of the circulating currency  it would also express that germany is not the successor state of west germany but the same country with an enlarged territory  in the case of the peng i would simply say that it was the currency of hungary between jan and jul northern  trans ylvania  southern slovakia and b  cska was totally incorporated into the hungarian administration  subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy  but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of then yugoslav federal states  present day us states or german federal states naturally  this is only my opinion  i would like to know your thoughts  ,acb1ecdbfb97b16b,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

13866,41876,  yes  i understand that the technical proposal is to rename the article  but i also appreciate that names matter it s also worth noting that this is the longest rename discussion i ve ever seen at wp apparently  i m not the only one who thinks the name of this article matters more than usual  i may be missing some very notable exceptions  as i have not been involved in the dispute until now  but i see no unbiased editors i see editors who either support the concept of men s rights or feminists that is to say  without belaboring the topic  i see two diametrically opposed ways of viewing the world one way says men of every society in every corner of the world developed abusive and patriarchal social structures that oppressed women the other way says that gender roles evolved by men and women working together in accordance with biological imperatives like survival that these gender roles limited  benefited and oppressed both sexes in different ways by forcing them to conform to the roles that society dictated feminist patriarchy theory has a fundamental need to attach male malice in the way gender relations evolved and inculcate guilt in modern day males for the supposed sins of their male predecessors tangential rant aside  if we can appreciate that there are two opposing sides here we can achieve a much better and balanced article but  instead  what we have on one side are a bunch of feminist editors  armed with all the sources that of feminist dominated academia can churn out disingenuously feigning to be unbiased  disinterested editors who are merely trying to apply wp policy to produce the best article possible on the other side  we have the men s rights activists  men s rights are  essentially  what men s rights activists say they are if the article  men s rights  doesn t have at least of its content from sources that point to men rights activists a term that i see used pretty pejoratively on the men s rights talk page  then the article is hopelessly biased all feminist sources regarding men s rights are  essentially  sources that respond to the arguments and or actions of men s rights activists  male or female  to base more than of the article on the feminist response to the article s topic is a poor way to write an article such an article can easily occur here if we try to stick to the best wp rs without including both sides  because we have failed to acknowledge that there are  in fact  two sides here as we will end up with an article that amounts to men s rights according to feminists  the reason for which being that the men s rights activist source may be from some small publisher or self published but the women s studies text will be published from oxford press  ,6fb999b1eb714142,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

56518,3679, xkcd  hey a fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for nasa from the short article on me  randall munroe labeling it patently made up information understandable and taken in good humor  of course  and nothing on the page is sourced  it s more of a stub than anything but i m curious why you were so sure it was fabricated  xkcd i find it hard to believe that a year old could have been working full time for nasa  of course  you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that nasa would have been all over  but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe schreit mich an  i interned there during college and started working for them a bit before i graduated i stayed for the better part of a year until late nasa is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects it s not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets anyway  the information is taken from my published bio page  but you re right  you have no way of knowing whether i m lying or not i guess it s probably safest to assume that i am  in that case  i ll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place  i know very little about science  but anyone who got to work for nasa has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area feel free to re add the info  although the impression i got from the original version was more than you weren t just a contract worker  if that s not even a valid distinction in the states it s increasingly less of one here in oz then my apologies there in advance schreit mich an honestly  they never really explained to me which one i was i went to work every day in a building at nasa where i worked on nasa robots  and nasa paid me  through a government contractor when i said i work for nasa no one argued  it was a lot more dilbert esque than you would expect old  echoing tile hallways with quiet  gruff middle aged men working at blueprint covered desks  mild office politics  lots of presentations and buzzwords  and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way i thought it sounded like the perfect place to work  and it was good in a lot of ways  but i was happy to leave xkcd can you nominate my entry hey bighaz  can you please show me how the nomination process goes for dyk  i mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated  actually  this thing is new to me  thanks sure thing  the way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the hook that gets put onto the suggestions page  which i ll move it to in a moment  over the next few days  people will make various comments about it if the hook is too long  if it needs sources  w hate ver else  if you re able to respond to those comments  if there are any made then your article might get selected schreit mich an by suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what it s not easy to do that  since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page  so i really can t just point you to a page and say here you are what particularly do you want to see  if you re after examples of the kinds of comments people make  just keep an eye on the suggestions page schreit mich an caucasian ethnicities semites are caucasian  or indeed not  see  for example  semitic  which clearly indicates otherwise  they speak wildly different languages to those spoken by indo european people  who are the ones we normally call caucasian so unless there s some startling new research out there  i don t think that comment is accurate schreit mich an  i m not even going to dignify this with a response  use,09d799902866c75b,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

18911,153150, bp first of all  i understand that you have a stake in this article you ve put a lot of time and effort into it and you don t want to see it deleted i had an article deleted once  and i understand the frustration that you feel  if you read what constitutes a notable organization in wp n and wp org  it doesn t really meet the criteria set forth yes  you ve provided some sources that mention the bulldog party  but they aren t really considered  significant coverage which means  that sources address the subject directly in detail also  wp org states organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found  however  it does say that  the organization s longevity  size of membership  or major achievements  or other factors specific to the organization may be considered  the bulldog party may have been around in some form since the s  though  so maybe that might help  if you can prove it  the possible longevity and the major achievements and other factors specific to the organization is where you stand the best chance of defining why it s notable  because of this statement in the article  the bulldog party has inspired the formation of other student organizations on universities throughout missouri  most notably the bearcat voice at northwest missouri state university and the student progressive party at lincoln university  missouri however  this isn t sourced at all  and quite frankly  it s questionable whether the bearcat party article meet the notability criteria as well if i submitted this article to afd  would it definitely get deleted most definitely not there s a good chance that it would  but it s not a given however  no one could make the argument that it s good enough as it is and its notability shouldn t be questioned  why has no one else brought this up before since you first created in march probably because it hasn t attracted a lot of attention and overall  it s well written there aren t many other articles that link to it  so unless someone stumbles across it through those links  the only other way someone will find it is via random pages  unlikely with over million other articles  or through recent changes  and since there have been barely over edits in years  that s not likely  either  especially if the edit wasn t vandalism keep in mind that none of these arguments make an article notable or worth keeping i like it  or it s interesting it took me a long time to write this other student political party has an article it looks good  or it doesn t do any harm i m not going to submit this article to afd  but you really need to work on getting it fixed  if possible because it s likely that someday someone else will come across it and come to the very same conclusion that i did about it  good luck  and happy editing  ,98352cb967a93b6a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
