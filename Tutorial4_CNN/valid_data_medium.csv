56852,27520, yes they are garish  though per wp redlinks they can encourage people to make new articles and help expand wiki  the only problem is that a lot of sis have names that don t match area names in reality  so it s tricky to find matching articles in many cases  a bit of local knowledge helps in that respect  to link colloquially named articles to formal names used by the government  up to you if you want to retain or remove them  there is no strict policy as to their use  only not to intentionally red link trivial things not notable enough to ever need an article  chat rff ,48d50b2116a853b6,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

15840,98752, ai thanks for the message on my talk page no harm done  as i was offline of wp briefly at the time myself  and i learned a lot in the process of restoring and improving the article to wp notability standards  a lesson i ve applied elsewhere i also learned more about the wp distinction between primary and secondary sources the result is all to the good  i ll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing  though i think on first sight that the template s terse wording this article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past could be clearer as to its intent  does this really suffice to  in your words  let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason i hope so  though it was not obvious to me  it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue if you can see it that way  as a relatively novice editor might  perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect  with some procedural directives and relevant links  to the original prod and the policy guidelines for continuance i defer to your experience and good judgment  btw  since you liked kurzweil s other book  the singularity is near is certainly worth a skim  moore s law on steroids  a fascinating perspective  from ai s greatest optimist  thanks again  atama  and welcome back  ,1044166b24e08ccb,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
9319,29398,  please read unblock request carefully  this why i ask whoever read my request to read it carefully i will address your points in order of when your address them first  your said that you will work with the editor to help make the page notable  yet that is what i was asking for throughout the entire debate before i was  block for someone to help me make the page notable  i cannot help showing i was annoyed when everyone who posted on that debate was making negative comments and continued to push for it to be deleted  seen as i was the person making all the editing  it is the responsibility for administrators to assist me making all pages in question notable  i had already said sorry for the choice of words i ve made throughout the debate but again it is as if no one has the desire to care whether a user is remorseful of his action so long as the debate can continue  with or without them  second  if the only party that was trying to defend the case was  block  and prevent not only from actively defending the pages in question  but stopped from actually adding the references and making the page more notable  well i m sorry but i was doing my best all things considering  even before i was  block  from wikipedia  i did add in more reference  i read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes  however i am only one person and there is so much i could do before i can say i done my fair share  can someone help me finish this but clearly not  i really don t know wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do  but considering i have made many pages and edited many more in the short time i have started using wikipedia properly  i can say that i have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this  my point with this is that even though i have made massive contributions on here  there are things i do not know  and how to get pages back on wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them  so if you kindly give me details and links on how to do this would be most appreciated i still fail to see why it is disrupted behaviour to return pages back on wikipedia the way i have  a page before on ryan shamrock  fighter  was speedily deleted and then returned back on here  but not by me  and up until just today  no one has affected that  the user who is suggesting it has also recommended other pages for deletion  however  the user clearly doesn t know the fighters he wants deleted  as of them are have competed in either a major mma promotion or a second tier promotion  as he is doing such pointless acts  i still wonder why he s able to do this knowing he will get into trouble with other admins for the similar things i ve done  here is the link for this debate wikipedia articles for deletion ryan shamrock  fighter i get what you do mean when you say that it isn t about shark fights or ring of combat when it comes to this debate now  but none the less it is still an issue not to be ignored  ucmma cage rage uk was deleted for the same reasons that those two promotions  as well as a few other promotions on wp mmanot  should be  i find it amazing how these promotions are actually accepted by certain admins and are allowed to remain on there whilst a promotion i ve been helping with  that has a better laid out page than the others and was making the improvements the other users were screaming on about doing for it  yet it got deleted  whilst those others ones get treated like they are highly ranked promotions  ucmma cage rage uk has a weekly chat show on sky sports whilst showing their delayed timed events on sky sports i bet those other promotions don t even get tv time the head of cage rage uk never asked me to post those articles  i have always worked by myself to help them with their wikipedia page  never even expecting a thank you because i like their product and want to help other find reliable sources on them  which as many knows  wikipedia is the place for that  if you type in ucmma in the facebook search bar  find the one with a picture of the words  cage  on the top rage  in the middle  and  uk com  at the bottom  then like their page  then keep looking for any posts from carl gale  as i keep mentioning to look on wikipedia for ucmma cage rage uk information  fights at certain events etc  look as far back as the  st september you will clearly see that not only was ucmma not part of it  they were pretty much telling me that all their information can be found on their website and their facebook account so there was no need to continue doing it  however  i kept working on the wikipedia pages  making contributions whenever possible leading up until their ucmma hands of war event  once a few days went by after the event  the head of media for cage rage uk started to post wall messa,4dfe55daa920e23a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

114979,53246,oh dear rick  we are back your misunderstanding of what probability means i am not sure if we are allowed to discus this any more  perhaps it is ok on this page richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability  bayesian and frequentist although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument i am happy to discuss the mhp using either model but let us start with the bayesian perspective first to a bayesian  probability is a state of knowledge that is the definition of what bayesian probability means in the bayesian model  what is not known does not exist that is not something  that i have just made up  i am sure richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using wp or any good text book so  if the player does not know where the car is placed  or the host s door opening strategy  the probability of winning by switching is exactly it may be that the car is always placed behind door and the host always opens door but  if we do not know that  it makes no difference to our  bayesian  probability calculation  which depends by definition only on the information that we have the concept of average probability makes no sense  there is just  the probability  which is based only on our state of knowledge ,8e5792c728553a62,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

139784,36298,the text of the article could have been taken from tudjman era croatian propaganda press  the consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality  or revalue the widely accepted view of croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased  some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing  particularly the plight of the city s inhabitants of serbian nationality about half of the total number in the city subject to croatian military rule  or the very existence thereof  parts of the text are clearly self contradictory  the croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed  yet they still manage to down warplanes  and full of dubious propaganda cliches  the backbone of jna was broken at vukovar one does not need to be an expert on war in the balkans to note these shortcomings  naturally  this does not mean that we should subscribe to the serbian propaganda of the time an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from icty proceedings  from well known western reporters present at or near the scene  misha glenny and from other sources  actually  merely citing these sources will do a better service to the reader than this  numbers  we need sources and references for the numbers ,60fce7ccdf0b6b8f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

8461,45216,  now that is a heavily biased remark if i ever saw one  talk about racism  and no  arguments like korean is a nationality  not a race doesn t make my accusation any less valid  because then i would just say talk about anti korean bias or anti korean prejudice  true  appletrees may have some antagonism towards the japanese  though i suspect it s only towards ultranationalistic japanese who he she feels has affronted korean nationalism but making such blanket statements like the one above isn t any better  yes  i identify myself as korean as well  but i know idiocy when i see it  be it korean  japanese  or otherwise and just because everyone on this world uses sea of japan doesn t mean that it s not valid to investigate why  or to ask the question is that the right thing to do saying things like everyone on this world uses  sea of japan as if it were the end of the debate for something as nebulous as the way things were named in the imperialist era is not only intellectually stifling  but also works to limit free speech  ,78e77b50561f8359,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

421,60471,  ali  as i ve wrote  none of those authors are aware of many important details  such as kurekchay treaty an official and legal treaty which defined the entry of karabakh into russian empire  at the same time  the khan of sheki too signed a similar treaty  for example  i know michael croissant  and his book is full of mistakes and errors  his book doesn t mean much in this regard  his mistakes are too gross  the russo iran war started in whilst karabakh became part of russia in before such a war  meanwhile  tim potier is a good legal expert  and it is surprizing to see him write that  but everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of karabakh in th century was not his objective  the th century was  anyways  i do not know the khans of iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with british  if they did it in the zand period  they probably had full legal right at the time  since iran was more of a geographic entity  than political  same with azerbaijan  north it was geographic too  whilst i do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time  the later russian and british documents clearly identified azerbaijanis of the north as aderbeijani tatars i have evidence of that as far back as in british census estimates and in the official russian imperial census  same word is used by russian ethnographer velichko in his book  azerbaijani author  firudin bey kocharly wrote a book in literature of azerbaijani turks anyways  azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both iran and russia at the time  and some sided with either one side or another  unfortunately  you won t find much on that in libraries but just one such  trans lated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions  what is more important however  is that karabakh khan  khan being a turkic term derived from kagan was that it concluded its own treaty  that it minted its own money  one of the typical examples of independence and fought several wars with iran  some handily winning  others  like ambgiously  but still shah muhammed qajar gets killed  and i don t know who told you about vagif and ibrahim  by the later you probably mean ibrahim khan  right  well  vagif  the poet and vizier  was executed in after shah s death  and was executed by the temporary ruler  mamed bey jevanshir  who was nephew of ibrahim khan  while details are murky and contradictory  the qajars didn t have the primary rolse in this  indeed  once shah was killed  iranian troops withdrew  it screwed up all the plans to re conquering other parts of azerbaijan and georgia  meanwhile  ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error or so it is explained  in but anyway  the kurekchay treaty was signed by him  thus  once more  karabakh khanate  for one  was totally independent  and iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it  meanwhile  few other khanates were nominally dependent like poland was to ussr  or armenia to russia  russian speaker of parliament person in the country  openly called it forepost of russia whilst in armenia ,a1e13fc789597488,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

21139,105779, dear administrator this morning i edited derrick bell s page and added a link from a nyt article that state that one of his famous essays  the trade spacers is considered antisemitic by many people a few hours later  the addition was deleted i posted it again  and noticed that another user did the following march hj mitchell  talk contribs m bytes protected derrick bell  violations of the biographies of living persons policy  i found this action abusive as bell has been dead for months i proceeded to go to this user talk page and posted the following i find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that space traders is considered an antisemitic essay  even though there was a link to the original article from nyt where it was discussed and prominent professors like dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work  there is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people s philosophy  the reason that people have started shunning wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts  if someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that bell left the deanship at oregon law school because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school  i could understand that  but there are articles about his antisemitism  bell s page does not even include his racist comments about clarence thomas  the choice of clarence thomas replicates the slave masters  practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters  views  also  prioryman  name calling people you disagree with dunderheads really diminishes wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots the user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment  but deleted it i posted the following later march utc dear hj  do you represent the wikipedia censorship brigade  i do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what i did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are nyt article s about bell s antisemitism  as well as questioning why you locked the page since bell is dead  i am a simple person  the type of people that wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at bell s page and here are what sours people with wikipedia  is not it bigoted behavior for prioryman to call people that have opposing views dunderheads i am sorry but ypur behavior  as well as prioryman s  along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers  the facts are the facts  is not the gray lady a sufficiently legitimate source then that user pressed the bell so i will be  block i may have been naive and thought that senior members in wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues  i was not trying to harass or attack anyone to the contrary  i have been totally respectful of everybody  however  if the behavior that i encountered today is the typical behavior of the administrators senior staff  then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed  or it may be because hj lives in england where free speech is not allowed  as americans  that s one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended  free speech is what makes us different from europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish  instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in europe i am really surprised by this whole behavior  is this high school  or what  we are all adults and we should engage in conversation  not call mom when we do not like something  my ten year old does this  not an adult  ,35f437fca3cc80bf,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

30928,103260, if there is a credible link to a us gov t definition for the capacity of a tradable barrel of oil  then it should be referenced in the main article as the article states  there are several definitions for the capacity for a barrel or gallons i highly doubt that the us gov t is or was responsible for defining the capacity of a barrel of crude oil used for commerce  or that it is a world wide legal requirement to use a us gov t definition  but if there is any such legal requirement then again a reference should be stated in the main article to say that nymex has no legal right to define measurement units is a bogus argument what nymex has is the right to define or specify units that are pertinent to trade if nymex states that oil is to be traded in terms of barrels  then it is not illegal for nymex to state the capacity of this thing called a barrel in terms of unambiguous standard units  or to point to an authoritative source  authoritative as far as nymex is concerned  that defines the capacity of a barrel  ,28a0739954eca5f9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

2039,96781,  dear mr  bunkov  thank you kindly for your note  it is always a thrill to have someone working close to a certain subject to join the ranks of wikipedia editors  welcome again  i look forward to future cooperation  and i am sure other participants of wikiproject russia will be equally delighted  that said  i feel obligated to comment on the situation you are in  pardon me if you are already familiar with what i am about to say  but i feel it s safer to include it for the sake of completeness  since you are not an individual editor but rather a representative of a government organization  you should be extra mindful of wikipedia policies and guidelines covering your position  of which he guideline on the conflict of interest is the most significant  another important point is that wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia  so it s not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional  even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor  and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything  one cannot prohibit others from editing one s additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others  this  in fact  is one of the five pillars of wikipedia  this isn t to say that you must agree to each and every change others make to things you add  but all such disagreements should be resolved within the framework of applicable policies and guidelines  you ll notice  for example  that i ve made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the kaluga oblast article this is not because the style you used is somehow inferior  but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on russian oblasts  at any rate  style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance  and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of wikipedia s manual of style  you should not  however  be surprised when others fix it  style issues aside  wikipedia is all about content  of course  it s understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share  but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources  what this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source  and the source must be a reliable one  published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and or with editorial oversight  ultimately  this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources  and in your situation it means that sources produced by the government of kaluga oblast in general and by the agency for regional development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary  not secondary  source  primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts  but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed  in other words  it s ok to to use a primary source to back up a statement that kaluga oblast s grp in was billion rubles  but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like this demonstrates the oblast s high economic potential with formalities and general introductions taken care of  let s address your question about kaluga oblast somehow being a wrong  trans lation  that actually is not the case  the term oblast is a loanword in the english language  included in all major dictionaries  and it is much more precise than a more vague region territory or province this isn t to say that any of those terms are wrong they are not but they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as wikipedia s due to their ambiguity  this issue had been discussed on several past occasions  and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one  precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article s title  note also that all major english language reference works use the term oblast see  for example  encyclopedia britannica additionally  since the article about kaluga oblast is a part of the series on the russian oblasts  its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles  wp nccs is the applicable guideline covering all this  if you are interested in reviewing it  i hope this has been helpful  i apologize for dumping so much information on you all at once  but since your situation is different from that of a regular editor  i feel certain points should have been touched upon  if you have any further questions or need anything clarified  you are welcome t,05a5029cb75572f2,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

73508,10188,did christians invent satan  the idea that christians invented satan is lies  propogated by some adherents of wicca and other pagan believers  we see that the holy scriptures that came from judaism has a book called job  so why blame the christians rather the scriptures reveals in genesis how eve was tempted by the serpent  who had refused to worship adam  also later we see that david is tricked into taking a census by satan  old testament samuel  later on further we see that jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of beelzebul  satan  by pharisees  jesus refutes the accusations of the pharisees  in the nt we hear that i saw satan cast out of heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the west  so also in revelations we hear that there was war in heaven and st  michael and all the loyal angels to god fought against the followers of satan and the battle was won by the good angels  revelation also reveals  woe unto man for the devil has come down to earth  being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short  also elsewhere we hear that satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour  christ was tempted by the shaitan times after his baptism in the desert  so to say that we christians invented something which was already revealed in judaism and ot is silly and obnoxious  the devil had pride  then disobedience  then jealousy  then slander  then much later we learn that jesus called the satan a liar  murderer and thief  why dont the wiccans look to zoroastriaism or other dualistic religions and see the concept of good versus evil in those religions  why  so that the christians get the blame for something that actually exists  even the muslim believe in a the serpent called iblis  and even buddhists had a concept for the evil one called mara  who was a tempter  jesus even spoke to st  peter and said that the devil had been given permission to sift st  peter like wheat  whereby jesus siad that he had prayed for cephas such that he would not enter into temptation  the truth seems to be that the devil was an arc angel in heaven  who became too full of himself  later whe god created man in his own image  god requests all the angels to bow to adam  all do except for one angel  later called lucifer he refuses based on himself being made of fire and that adam is made of clay  however  god allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in job  some mention that in isaiah  o lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the heavenn is a direct reference to the devil  but i also consider it to babyloon  as in revelation  fallen  fallen is babylon the great etc  revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life  god has talks with the satan  so satan can not be inferred thence to be a non entity  as god does not talk to non entities  also some people believe that the dark side of human nature to be some impersonal evil  others realise that this is negative non sense  i know that people were possessed by demons  fallen spirits and that jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming  ha  jesus you nazorean  what hast thou to do with us  hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us jesus then would tell the demon s to shut up or be quiet  so far as i concerned the truth is in the holy bible  some truth is also in the quran  there are some truths to be found also in other religious books  but the whole truth is christ and the books of ot and nt are inspired by the holy spirit  have a read of revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from god  enough of this rubbish about christian inventions of spirits  pagans invented their gods  and invented strange myths concerning their false gods jew s and christians had the opposite  god revealed to them the truth and the way  and the life thanks email  james hernon hotmail com the next seion is not written by me  james hernon ,1af4e4f0a96b7619,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

153399,140806,wp triv does not say that trivia should not be on wikipedia  just that it should not be in greater focus than the article as a whole  and the difference between the editing you described and the anon edits i reverted was that the anon tag additions were the sole basis of his edit history  you have a varied edit history  also  the tag was put on articles that it clearly did not belong on  such as articles with relevant trivia in very small amounts  and pages that were explicitly labeled as trivia  wp triv says to be cautionary with trivia  not to remove it entirely  and if you interpret it otherwise  that is an issue to debate  the anon disrupted wp to possibly prove the point that trivia does not belong in wp  which is explicitly forbidden  now  i did not judge him solely because he was anon  but because of the massive amounts of editing done by an anon in a short period of time  without any variation whatsoever  no  being anon is not enough to condemn him  neither is a specific edit to a lot of pages  it is the fact that he is anon  an d doing a massive amount of edits and said edits are not fully constructive  the toomuchtrivia tag is only to be used when trivia is so numerous as to unbalance an article  some of the pages  like the bull shit article had very little trivia  and the trivia it had was rather constructive  also  there were some pages explicitly labeled as trivia pages that got the tag  this tag was abused in this case  on the individual articles  should editors feel that the tag was useful  as was seen on the wonderful life  kill bill  and dolly parton pages  i will respect that ,f1788307599e2334,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

34238,136976, leejc is absolutely right  he did a better job expressing what i tried to say back in june but while i agree with his final conclusion  it isn t quite the right argument to use  that we must assume the worst  to get it  so i thought i would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem  that seem to say the same thing  can lead to different solutions the ultimate cause of confusion is the math specific definition of the term event  when a random experiment produces a result  that result is not called an event  it is an occurrence  event is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property  so if i flip a coin a hundred times  there are only two possible events heads and tails  there will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event  and each occurrence will fit into only one event if i draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards  there are lots of possible events and or occurrences  some of them overlap  they include black card  spade  honor card  tjqka ace  and ace of spades  the occurrence black card can be in the event spade or club as well  note that an occurrence can fit into other events  but not vice versa  an occurrence of spade is also an occurrence of black card  but the event spade is most definitely not the event black card  since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events  the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied there is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event  it is called bertrand s box paradox suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes  each with two indistinguishable drawers  inside each drawer is a coin  box has two gold coins  box has two bronze coins  i can t resist the temptation to use the initials b and g and box has one of each  you pick a box at random  and open a drawer at random  if the coin is gold  what are the odds that the coin in the box s other drawer is also gold  i e that it is box the first issue here  common to story problems  is that this problem describes an occurrence  not an event  we must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are  to define the event  the set of possible occurrences  that defines the conditional probability the incorrect approach to bertrand s box paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities  box and box that the event matches the observation the box has at least one gold coin  this is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event  if you pick box then no matter which drawer you open  the occurrence is in the event the box has at least one gold coin  the correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin  every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event  remember  it s a set and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description  both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition  this set has three elements  not two  in two of those three possible occurrences  the box s other coin is gold  the correct answer is i have seen a variation of bertrand s box paradox used to represent the boy or girl paradox  you are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet  during the meet  you get a phone call from mr  smith  who is delayed and can t pick up his children after the meet  he says tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor  their names are sarah and  and the phone connection goes dead  there are four families of two children in the meet  and they conveniently include the four possibilities bb  bg  gb  and gg  what are the odds that mr  smith has two daughters this occurrence can be described as a two child family includes at least one girl  but not the event you need to use as the condition  mr  smith could have mentioned a boy s name first  and if that boy had a sister  that occurrence would have been an element of the set a two child family includes at least one girl  so that event fails one of the two criteria  you get the answer by erroneously using this event the correct event is just that mr  smith mentioned that he had a daughter  and compares to you opened a drawer with a gold coin in the box paradox  you can count four possible occurrences of that event  in two of those four  representing a single family  sarah has a sister  the correct answer is or if a conditional probability question describes an occurrence  and not an event  care needs to be taken whe,dccf0d4e6c9178c8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

39745,44723, passion killing in namibia introduction  in the cambridge advance learner s dictionary  passion is defined as a very powerful feeling  for example of  sex  attraction  love hate anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder  in this context passion killing is combined passion killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger  love hate  or other emotions in the past passion killing in namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend  recently  a large number of continuous passion killing cases have been reported  so far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women  breakups and infidelities being of the main reasons amongst many in this article i m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society  who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence the causes the question on everyone s lips is  why are men killing women amongst many causes  the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support  for things such as accommodation  tuition fees in a case of a student  food  clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case  men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits  the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women the namibian namibian another major cause that leads to passion killing in our society is infidelity from women  when a woman cheats and the men finds out  the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing  a possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women causes  who is at fault  as i have observed  both men and women are to be blamed in different cases firstly  certain men are at fault are because they don t seem to understand the real meaning of love  the country should cry out for help  true love is patient  love is kind it does not envy  it does not boast  it is not proud  it is not rude  it is not self seeking  it is not easily angered  it keeps no record of wrongs  love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth  love always protects  always trusts  always hopes  always perseveres bishop kleopas dumeni even if love is not involved  as it is in some cases  one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property in other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it  in the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing  women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost  but little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life  women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons  be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface  then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing recommendations recommendations  the solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this nation  knowing the diversity of people  it s hard to figure out what would impact certain people never the less  the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on  informante a number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty  but i believe one cannot fix another evil with evil so what is the exact answer to the problem  should we bring back the death penalty  will it stop the passion killings ,777d5df4aa68d581,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

137163,143099,the  arguments  above consist of reiteration  i also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation  certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production  which are also found in animation from other countries  whether the usa  korea  or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market this definition would exclude miyazaki  who  indeed  excludes himself  unlike his western fans likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition  yes  the ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as marvel dc superheroes  and certainly deserves a specific article  but this is not the same as tokusatu  ergo  tokusatu is not a genre  should not be so quick to assume what people do and don t know about  my original comment may have been sharp but was in response to an i will not be questioned tone  and i certainly know enough to contribute to this article  however  i strongly disagree with the classification and crufty tone and thus won t  usage on the japanese wikipedia does not have any bearing  the large number of separate articles on japan related topics that could well be included under the more general headings is definitely a fan driven form of exceptionalism ,fd444b6e6e5d25f3,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

97554,39953,i will suggest you to be more careful not to be the source of a new chaos instead of defusing one it will be most distressing to witness such one again you took some mesures who are unlikely to be the right ones in that case  and it will crave a certain degree of familiarity with the subject and its history to can handle the task properly  do not dismiss users with longer experience with the case as it was based on this experience that the talk page was brought out  for instance  i received mails from the person who wrote the biography of the affair both for the french and the english talk page  as those din t knew enough about the matter to start with  if i were you  i will feel suspicious of receiving approuval and encouragemets about what you are doing  from a person who first heard about this affair for weeks ago  second  heard about it from ybm  the drive force of this affair and person who resurected it from ashes in nov so not much reliable as an eye opener and arbitrary source of informations  and third  who has conducted  since then  a revert war in the best anti  rr rules  and best ybm styles it isn t right for an admi to emit subjectiv and judgementals accusations toward users  as calling them socket puppet and other insulting terminology  as it is usually to be found in the mouth of the persons who in shortage of argumentation  choose to attack people personnaly in best sophistics style  so no surprise that the person who rever you is the same one who used that language constantly against other users before you stepped in  and who was also doing the reverting job as you are doing it now it is abusively unclear  what you are trying to do  and i do hope that a more adequate person will take over the surveillance of this talk page  one with the right degree of integrity  the proper knowledge of the stuff  here physic  a thourough insight in the affair and its history  and a knowledge of the people involved and their characters and profile in regard to the topic  i think here of nicholas turnbull  administrator  and expert in mediation i have  unfortunately  to aknowledge the fact that your latest actions have resulted in creating a turmoil on the site  based both on your actions and your utterings  and that you have provocated of the users  who had already been harshly provocated by user r b j for several weeks and needed therefor the administrators help to put an end to it  not to overtake the place of the source of turmoils i do believe that you are acting your best with your actual knowledge of the facts  but nonetheless you should be more carefull to don t bruise som ego by commiting unfully justified and unjust actions in the process  and as a consequence endanger the quality of the talk page as those arguments for and against have been dancing in parallel for far too long time  without everreaching a solid ground of agreement  and as references made by anti bogdanov are always pointed at some unclear statement made by scientifics a long time ago  where most did redraw it  and as all those people of science didn t knew a thing about theoretical physic and or cosmologie  which this dispute is about  and as the positiv statements  made by specialists in the fields named above  are systematically unaccepted for tricky reasons  as are the statements made on this page by pro bogdanovian  who are called socket puppets for a yes or for a no  i suggest this affair to be settled once and for all by truly and undiscustably specialists in that field  i named holger beck nielsen professor of the copenhague niels bohr institut of theoretical physic  and stephen w  hawking  from the chair of mathematic of cambridge university i have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor holger beck nielsen attention to that matter  and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in england  i tried already to suggest this approach above  but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored  i will ask you to make a join effort to gather your attention on this particular possibility and think of how each of you can take part in its fullfillment  in the best interest of all parts involved lets work as a team  ,6aa41d2bcf59edfd,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

85794,11524,hi there i am a new user  about two months  and live a peripatetic life  migrating from nepal to st paul island  alaska with frequent stops in othello  washington  where i grew up ages ago  i m i have had several  careers  but now work as quality control and health and safety person  seasonally  for a small fish processing plant on st paul island to finance my travels  my wp editing is mostly typos and usage stuff  see slaying slews on my user page adding links to deadend pages  and i have started participating in some afd debates  although not many  i have created one new article  the short and rather minorly important corfu slide  i ve had one small run in with another editor  see re  my copyvio tag on user talk noroton regarding my mistaken blanking of an article for copyvio  i apoligized to him although i m not sure if the article had been cleared although the notice was removed  the primary reason i requested adoption was that i am looking for some direction on copyvio matters  i hit the random page button alot and also work on deadend pages and i seem to be seeing tons of stuff that violates copyright  obvious cut and paste jobs about companies or persons  usually with a link to the copyvio right at the end of the article looking at wp cv i seem to get conflicting directions  the first box advising proposing speedy deletion and leaving the article intact  the second box  titled  article saying to revert if possible  if not then blank the page  etc  then i see this some cases will be false alarms  for example  if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms  that does not affect their right to post it here under the gfdl  also  sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the web that was copied from wikipedia  in both of these cases  it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future in wp c which would seem to allow most of the things i have tagged and or deleted i have done different things at different times  deleted copyvio and left a stub if i think it notable  proposed speedy  blanked and listed  the  article option and with one exception  my mistake which i apologized for  i haven t received any feedback or i must admit that the laziness rather than the legality of it is what bothers me about this as in most cases the website and article creator are probably one and the same  but still  here is some examples  new page  west wisconsin telcom is a copy from the  about  page of  you guessed it wisconsin telcom the page was created in one edit by a user with no other edits and no user or talk page  marriage equality new york inc  is copied from  here  altoona community theatre which is copied from hereand here  what is the proper way of dealing with this propose speedy delete and leave page intact no clean revert so blank and use copyvio url w wwt net aboutus php  and the rest of the stuff in the  article box leave it for someone else to deal with and mind my own business wikipedia can be a little daunting to newcomers as there seems to be much jargon  abbreviations and references to seemingly conflicting wp pages and policies  i have no problem being bold but also don t want to be a  jerk it would be great to have someone with experience to check with on occasion  ok  that s what i m really wondering about right now  i have stopped doing anything about copyvio for now other than adding pages to my watch list until i get some direction on this  thnx ,1e77e0ba9a605e44,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

23008,100773, episodes  i see this a lot when you edit  but with half hour tv shows  but hour long episodes are counted as two  not one  i would say you wouldn t have to put those in  but the episode list has a section for the production code  so normally most shows icarly  how to rock jessie  etc  if it s an hour long episode for season one the code will be because it counts as two and since the wikipedia asks for a production code  i think it s needed  since itunes does not show production code order rather just list the episodes as their shown on tv  that do not include that  this is why i strongly feel that shows like victorious  episode  freak the freak out and others should be listed as two and not one  it was an hour long episode after all  and if you go back and check how many episodes nickelodeon ordered for the first season of victorious it says which was also confirmed by the shows creator dan schneider  i strongly disagree that it should say along with other shows that have been edited  ,1b581a6df8ece244,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

138727,16708,the malvern water cure for what it s worth  i concur that the malvern water article benefitted from the exercise  to me  the best indicator that  user jerem was acting in good faith on november with the talk malvern water advertising tag was that it was jerem who removed it following gyro s efforts  i came to that article late  so wasn t caught up in the earlier argy bargy  so to speak but i see that since the efforts surrounding that period  both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely  there certainly was quite a bit of reference to the malvern water article in our discussions  mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts  one  exemplified  by malvern water  and one  exemplified  by shakespeare  mind you  the william penn article might benefit from the latter style  but not necessarily i counted individual page citations for hans fantel s book nearly double that of schoenbaum in shakespeare the above discussions highlight another thing which the malvern water article exemplifies  how one can sometimes find the solution in the problem  the problem being the criticism  and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith  and see what  trans pires in this case an improvement  of course  this might not always be the outcome  but assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome  not everyone knows how to constructively criticise we typically learn that through experience  if we re lucky  in my own life  i d have handled many past situations differently in light of what i now know and by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith  if perchance they are maliciously based  that will become so self evident that it s impossible for any reasonable person to miss  even then  what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response  a funny old world indeed  what with that and the irony that the malvern water cure still seems to be working its magic  wotnow,2c11412908449ee1,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

49284,1997, the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory  it can t  because langan is not a member of academia  but then again  a theory need not be academic to be notable  for example  print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well  nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness  scholarly integrity  or intellectual merit  except possibly in the well indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves  and of course  their aspiring apprentices  whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article  this is correct  to his credit  he invites others to tag his assertions  however  this is a bit specious  for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant  verifiable assertions to make  he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others  thus  we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langan s assertions receive a separate citation  when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article  it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents  not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article  but given that the article already links to ample source material  anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false  irrelevant  or non neutral  unfortunately  he hasn t yet been able to lock onto this signal  he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat  he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself  by now  everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization  neither byrgenwulf  nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates  has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations  they are merely using the article  which is faithful to the material it cites  to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic  the ctmu  which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks  they do not like what the ctmu says  the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says  and what langan and the press say about the ctmu  hence  they do not like the article on the ctmu  this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulf s  trans parent strategy of attacking the theory through the article  attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger  meanwhile  he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy  and that his all too evident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well  oozing contempt  byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands  snide remarks  and self righteous  factually worthless criticism but not one relevant citation in hand  nothing he says is verifiable  as we have now repeatedly seen  he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert  this makes it very difficult  if not impossible  to take his demands seriously  ,05687bcb86751fc2,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

24619,138080, from wikipedia requested moves december rock band  video game rock band there is no page at rock band or rock band  as they re just redirects  hence no reason for the  video game  at the end  talk contributions actually  there was an article at rock band until somebody decided to merge it a couple of weeks ago  and that wasn t even a clear consensus if anything  both should redirect to rock music  which rock band was merged with so i don t think this is uncontroversial spyke  you beat me to the punch clearly the term rock band is well used in the wiki and this needs to be discussed i think moving as proposed would be too confusing since the distinction is rock band v rock band  dab that s what for is for  simply put for the genre of music rock music or somesuch  either way  rock band should not redirect to rock band  video game t  c  m  noting that a couple of thousand pages link to rock band  and most of them refer to a group of people playing rock music  and not to a video game  i think we can t have rock band redirecting to rock band  video game as it now does  on the other hand  far fewer pages link to rock band  and a higher proportion of them refer to the video game  thus  as far as internal linking is concerned  it makes sense to have rock band as a redirect to rock music  and to move rock band  video game  to rock band  placing hatnotes on both articles  the alternative would be to have rock band and rock band redirect to rock music  and leave rock band  video game  where it is  with a hatnote at rock music  the only reason to go with the second option would be if we think people are likely to type rock band into the search box when they re thinking of bands playing rock music one other thing why are we discussing this here  instead of at the article talk page i ve just copied the above from wp rm  where it was listed in the incomplete proposals section  consulting this talk page  a few sections up  it s clear that this page was just moved from rock band a little while ago  so before anybody decides to move it back  i thought i d try to bring all the discussion to the same page  i would also direct the attention of anyone interested to talk rock band  where i ve left a comment about why that page really needs to say redirected to rock music  unless someone does something about the broken links first ,e2eabd093db2c6d2,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

51417,35605, thoughts on a high school a  as i am  of course  well aware following my rfa  csd a  explicitly exempts schools do you believe that it applies to online schools  specifically  denver online high school i just removed the speedy deletion template  though i m not really sure it qualifies for the exception looking at their webpage  just added as an el to the article it looks like they probably are real  and seem at least somewhat connected to the denver public school system  though they also seem to charge fees  which confuses me if the are operated by the state  then they probably even meet the general all high schools are automatically notable afd exemption  obviously  the article needs clean up  but i d rather wait and see if it should even be an article before doing so  this is indeed  a public school  though private high schools are just as notable as public ones i don t see a mention of fees  but most public schools do collect some sort of fee  and almost all charge tuition to students from outside their district the article however was totally unacceptablemainly devoted to the names of the teachers  i removed that  but there is still much necessary rewriting the real question for an online school at this or any level  would be whether it is actually a separate school  or merely a programwe cannot necessarily go by the name it calls itself  if a program  it would best go in the article for the denver board of education  my feeling is that it an actual  separate school  but for something like this  a  rd party reference will be really helpful what it clearly is not is a mere tutoring center or support facility  which are almost never notable  talk that all sounds very reasonable to me  i figured erring on the side of caution  removing the a was the better choice thanks for the trimming  i ll go take a look and see if i can find any sort of third party sources  notability of high schools hi  i hope you have been well i seem to recall  and have stated  or mis stated  as the case may be  that i thought you may have said in the past that  verifiable  high schools are generally presumptively notable but  in the event i ve mis spoken as to what you said  feel free to correct me i made mention of my recollections at an afd where i ve not myself  voted  as of yet here wikipedia articles for deletion mesivta tiferes yisroel best  such is the accepted compromise  high schools have articles  elementary schools in the absence of special notability get merged  but the compromise like all informal and formal wikipedia rules  has effect only as long as people here want it to have effect  i think recent decisions have upheld this in general  but there are always one or two people who challenge it  such is probably the case here there may be other factors  though  which i mention them at the afd  talk inherent notability for elementary schools which have been blue ribbon schools i am contacting you because you participated in either the afd wikipedia articles for deletion kennedy middle school  cupertino  california  which resulted in a redirect or the deletion review wikipedia deletion review kennedy middle school  cupertino  california  which resulted in restoration of the article because it was once a blue ribbon school i have opened a discussion at wikipedia talk notability  organizations and companies  us elementary schools  inherent notability  for blue ribbon schools as to whether the schools which have been found awarded the blue ribbon seal of approval get inherent notability  or if they each have to satisfy wp org via significant coverage in multiple reliable and independent sources  your input is welcome  thanks  p s  should i have made this a rfc i rarely get involved in such general policy forums  the way we ve been doing it recently  it would best be to be made an rfc  but it should not be worded inherent notability but presumption of notability and  personally  though i care relatively little for these articles one way or anot,5f298ef046d0b579,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

43253,93847, regarding a wiki writer regarding the writer at http rexcurry net wikipedialies html and referenced at http en wikipedia org wiki talk  hitler  salute please note the following mr  barlow is a nutter with an obsession  the history of the salute is now improved in the roman salute article  which had many previous visits from dr  curry in the past see its talk page  as dr  curry attempted to correct the many errors the pact between the national socialist german workers  party and the union of soviet socialist republics is not well known  and is also not covered widely on wikipedia  so it is covered up by people  and those people also often refer to it as the  nazi  soviet pact  as the writer above does  which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid party  the national socialist german workers  party  and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand  nazi  and the myth that members of the national socialist german workers  party referred to themselves as  nazi s they did not refer to themselves as  nazi s some people  note the writer above  try to evade the point with odd comments such as it wasn t invented by wikipedia editors to conceal the word  socialism that comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word  nazi  to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party  the national socialist german workers  party  not only is that done in the title of the page cited  the  nazi  soviet pact page  it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the party never appears nor even the phrase national socialist  the writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand  nazi  even when discussing the very topic at hand the bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the national socialist german workers  party  as noted by professor curry  however  as anyone who looks at dr  curry s historic photographs of the salute can see  it developed into the same salute as that of the national socialist german workers  party  even the writer above concedes dr  curry s point that the flag was saluted with a normal military style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath  the writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the u s  flag it is as if the writer above is conceding the point made by professor curry  indeed  the writer seems to concede it with the comment anyway  even if the gesture had been the same  so what  it s just a gesture  the soviets used conventional salutes  does that mean that the us military are communists because they use the same gesture as the soviet military  it is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name union of soviet socialist republics and also uses the term communist instead of using the term socialist  the writer then attempts to avoid the issue  which is the origin of the straight arm salute  and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether salutes dictate particular dogmas nevertheless  the writer evades the topic that professor curry has raised  which is that francis bellamy and edward bellamy were  self proclaimed national socialists in the usa three decades before the national socialist german workers  party  and edward s book was an international bestseller trans lated into every major language  including german  which edward spoke and wrote  and where edward had studied as a young man  and that edward s dogma inspired nationalism clubs worldwide including in germany  yes  the roman salute page did once contain inaccuracies  and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point  but that is no reason for the writer to blabber with his use of the term conspiracy  it s just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia  the point is to correct error when you see it  and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like dr  curry  the john seigenthaler story from brian chase is another notorious example of wikipedia s untrustworthiness on wikipedia  the intellectually dishonest administrators block people who tell the truth  so it is specious to say that truth tellers simply need to correct the articles  the writer above also concedes that he is the wikipedia editor who became wiser by incorporating professor curry s discoveries the writer is to be thanked for crediting dr  curry with making it more widely available  it should be noted that the valuable information that professor curry provides is his own discovery dr  curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the roman salute in films derives from an academic article by martin winkler  professor curry pointed out that martin winkler did not realize at the time of winkler s article that the films were all pre dated by the use of the salute in the u s  pledg,faf0008f533c9465,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

86429,150540,honestly the way wiki is treating this is a joke  a  i could have cited news sites but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite b  if the person that wanted peer review felt like it  he would have sought it years ago  he chose not to do it  but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related  forums  and most ignored it  c  only the recent open source test of the work proved the mod algorithm is a major thing in math  again  github is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual mod algorithm that it was shown to be a  big thing  and since then some news sites have covered it  but i chose not to cite them due to imo they are not npov  but none the less they covered the story d  the fact is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings e  so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal  peer review  the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work  and i am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is now to summarize  we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki  and even pages created after his discovery that use his discovery  ie  the sieve of atkin mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work so now you have sieve of atkin using a mod algorithm  guess what that was in his paper  so does wiki acknowledge that  no  and i didn t even bother to waste my time of the mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the pyprimes test and i cited that very well  it s a program created in python  i cited the wiki python page  then i cited github for both pyprimes and the pyprimes testing now while math is m forte  i am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is  now anyone can download python  which i have done  and download pyprimes  which i have done  and run the tests  guess what just like a math experiment  it is duplicated so github and the tests which are not  new  should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math i myself became aware of the first paper in as did others in aademia  recently i became aware of  news sites  running stories citing what i copied  the links to the github tests while some here can say well it s not ama  so what  in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the pyprimes results shows prime spirals are a big deal now i tried to be npov in giving all sides of the story  adoni has a valid claim i can verify it and i chose not to  but i cited a drexel math forum and i could have cited many other math sites discussing his mod mod and mod prime work in the s  is this signficant  you bet it is since mod prime sieve aka atkin sieve is so his mod prime work is well before it now the github tests mentions  croft spirals that s due to in a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the work  my opinion now croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or w hate ver he is claiming the fact is anyone can document adoni with prime theory from the s saying mod mod and mod is the key years later sieve of atkin appears  well that s only a rehash of the adoni mod work from the s  yet no one is giving him credit croft puts out his mod work and its inserted into pyprimes on github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as i cited so a work on github verifies how important to primality the mod spirals are  but he says croft spirals  well guess what helixq is now out there and taking credit for the work of dr  adoni my site to a drexel math site from the s mentioning mod prime work  prime spirals  is a major cite  since adoni could care less about the ama or w hate ver  in all probability he will soon be nominated for a nobel on his work  that is how important it is  think about it  not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of eratosthenes  none of them  on a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow  the only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of eratosthenes and the prime spirals  and the winner was prime spirals  now i can cite recent news articles about it  laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the s who now all look foolish due,6e019e391650cfcc,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,1.0,1

36631,8963, narciso yepes s revolutionary technical developments this is a story that has been recounted numerous times by yepes and by his students you know  the guitar is a very unusual instrument  for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar  someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar  someone who s genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else  however  i have never felt that way about myself  when i was around i could play virtually everything written for the guitar  but i knew i needed a teacher  so i went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of vicente ascencio  a very famous man in spain  the first thing he asked me to play was a musical scale  i played a standard guitar scale using alternating i and m fingers  and i played it about as well as any guitarist i had ever heard  ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable  he played a scale on the piano  which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale  then  he picked up a violin  and played a scale much faster than i could play  he showed me a musical scale on several other orchestral instruments  and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if i was to be a musician  i tried again to match his accepted norm for scales  but i could not do so  i then told him that this could not be done on the guitar  and  in fact  no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments  he told me  too bad  but if you want to study music with me  you must give up the guitar  i expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm  well  i had two choices  one was to be the genuis of the guitar  to get mad and storm out the door  the other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept ascencio as my teacher  where i would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students  fortunately  i chose to stay and learn  for the door was open for ascencio to be my teacher  and i chose to swallow my pride and study with him  and this decision has made all the difference  i went home  thought about scales  and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand  i started using three fingers instead  ami  mia  iam and the next week  i was able to play a musical scale  he smiled  and told me that i did not have to give up the guitar after all  then  he asked me for a chromatic scale in  rds  and  again  the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing  by the next week  i had figured out a way to play  rds at the accepted tempo  thus we went  week after week  and i continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction  eventually  i had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar  as a result of the experience  i have come to understand one thing the minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius  and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher  is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end  you may also wish to look up yepes s three fingered scales trills techniques w blogs myspace com index cfm fuseaction blog view friendid blogid most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical technical theory of this  they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again but it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and  as all great ideas  so simple and logical  it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before yepes ever realized this theory  and that is just one of the many new techniques yepes invented  you may add your citation needed comments to call this into question  but it will not take away the facts of yepes s achievements  ,17d1a95711d3ef52,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

50364,69093, the vicious attacks on ward churchill  ward churchill appears to be the latest author attacked by a strikling super conservative country  i have been reading a lot about american sociology lately  as it relates to the violent suppresion of the left i knew little about churchill  and had a negative view of him because of his article and infamous little eichman quote i then stumbled upon one of his articles it was absolutly incredible ward churchill is an incredible historian  what do these attacks on ward churchill do they cause americans to shy away from reading churchill s work  and they send a clear message to others who may want to attack american foreign policy  that you can lose your job if you criticize america  that you will be attacked viciously if you criticize america it is the latest form of american suppression of the left i am just interested if there is a list of authors  or a book or article about those who have been swift boated like churchill if so  i would like to add this to the article i think americans need to know how americ ass ophisticated propoganda system operates including such books as which asks such questions as why has america had more people killed in labor disputes than any other country why doesn t america have a labor party like other industrialized countries why are union numbers so low in america compared to other industrialized countries as ellen schrecker said  political repression in america is american as apple pie american inquisition  the era of mccarthyism  tape joe mccarthy and the loss of china  i have the greatest admiration for your propaganda  propaganda in the west is carried out by experts who have had the best training in the world  in the field of advertizing  and have mastered the techniques with exceptional proficiency yours are subtle and persuasive  ours are crude and obvious i think that the fundamental difference between our worlds  with respect to propaganda  is quite simple  you tend to believe yours and we tend to disbelieve ours  soviet correspondent based five years in the u s when i first visited russia  in i made friends with a musician whose father had been brezhnev s personal doctor  one day we were talking about life during  the period of stagnation the brezhnev era it must have been strange being so completely immersed in propaganda i said  ah  but there is the difference  we knew it was propaganda replied sacha  that is the difference  russian propaganda was so obvious that most russians were able to ignore it  they took it for granted that the government operated in its own interests and any message coming from it was probably slanted and they discounted it in the west the calculated manipulation of public opinion to serve political and ideological interests is much more covert and therefore much more effective  its greatest triumph is that we generally don t notice it or laugh at the notion it even exists  lessons in how to lie about iraq august by the observer uk ,b8d89babf0cd2733,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

34960,135574, macedonians hi realek  sorry if i didn t awnser yesterday  but you seemed a bit angry with me  so i decided that letting some time pass would have helped to calm all down  now  passing to your last message  let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections  now i ll try to awnser your points tito s actions had a number of important consequences for the macedonians  the most important was  obviously  the promotion of a distinctive macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of yugoslavia  the process of ethnogenesis gained momentum  and a distinct national macedonian identity was formed  the first part was already there tito s actions had a number of important consequences for the macedonians  the most important was  obviously  the promotion of a distinctive macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of yugoslavia  as for the second part  the process of ethnogenesis gained momentum  and a distinct national macedonian identity was formed i admit responsability  but i only wanted to mean that the birth of the srom represented the completition of the formation of a macedonian national identity  not that macedonians were invented in an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of macedonian nationalism  like misirkov and delchev  if you want to put it better  feel free to do it  greek macedonians are actually an ethnic group i think you know quite well how i feel about this  as i clearly stated it in the talk page  but sometimes compromises are necessary  and after all  it s only stated that greek macedonians live in macedonia  not that they represent an ethnic group  and it does seem that the greeks who live in macedonia call themselves macedonians like those that live in crete call themselves cretans  tito separated yugoslav macedonia from serbia i think you must have wrongly interpreted this  i simply thought it meant that macedonia was administratively separated from serbia  under whose control in the kingdom of serbia before and that of yugoslavia after it had been there was no resentment towards the bulgarian repression during the beginning of the bulgarian occupation of the region  by removing that sentance  honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me  but i can t help noting now that the statement is unsourced  personally  i don t know how macs reacted to bulgarian occupation  after all  my field is ancient  not modern macedonia  in conclusion remember that i only edited telex s text  without adding new statements  in my view  the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the macedonians were invented in is in collecting good  strong sources  for example  to make some names  danforth s macedonian question or poulton s who are the macedonians  as for telex  you should remember that it s a wiki rule to not bite newbies  telex is a very recent that is among us only since april and is clearly not a nationalist  but a honest editor who is striving to be npov  if you believe to see bias in his editing  remember that every single editor here  me included  obviously  has his pov  and it s a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing  this is why wikipedia has great possibilities  because our bias are emended by the work of others  sorry this was so long  ciao ,d50e3bcc8726d662,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

11593,107446,  the problem is not only with the sections concerning controversy about media coverage the major problem is that many major points about the greek debt crisis are missing in the lead and the article  even though it consists of pages  this is addressed in section pages  but still main points missing section why did greece need fiscal austerity in the midst of its crisis section pov lead debate two weeks ago  i proposed in this section to have the main points at least in summary style in the lead  as important ones are not even in the article  just let s only take the first point listed in being joining the euro without sufficient financial convergence and competitiveness in the summary list of causes for the greek debt crisis  it is the major single and early root cause for the greek debt crisis  without this root cause greece could technically not have had this debt crisis because it could always have printed itself out of every debt volume as they did before with the drachma  but this cause is missing in the wp pages and in the wp lead  the current lead only lists normal problems like structural weaknesses and recessions even though it is clear that greece faced those normal problems for decades and always solved them with high drachma inflation if needed so without naming the root cause there is no cause for the greek debt crisis  what happened after i proposed to have the main points in the article  at least in the lead as a summary  and also invited everybody to add change delete from my proposed the main point list  there were strong opponents working in a coordinated action  threatening to fight any significant change  saying one can not summarize a greek debt crisis  saying greek interests  need to have  a prominence when describing the debt crisis in wp  saying they will not let other editors summarize it  and so on  so we have almost new pages in the talk section  and main points about the lemma not in the article  like it was during the last years ,3e604fdedd8ef262,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

24092,47142, first  you are misreading what your first source is  the document you reference is a un interum report on resolution dates back to that document  the report  does not reflect any agreement between the un and israel calls for many things  but there had been no public pledge from israel on dismantling the sla  in fact  israel in public had been saying the opposite  they were not planning to leave until early july  the report being issued on the nd isn t very meaningful  its coincidence  there was a whole series of meetings between the sla  see later material  and un various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on second  i think its better to deal with charbel barakat s fuller and more accurate version of what happened in may from his congressional testimony in june during the month of may our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the united nations in nakura in south lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus  during the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the us  uk  and french embassies in israel and at the united nations  and on may our representatives met with the office of the secretary general of the united nations in new york instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously  the united nations declined to assist us the united states  uk and france dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the beirut regime the state of israel only prepared for our potential exodus  ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves  despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds  our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the un to deploy its units around our villages on may and as israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the sla was absent in france  the mostly shiite sector of the security zone collapsed  it appeared that shiite officers were told by the israelis that they must leave before the borders closed  even after the invasion of hizbollah of this area  the mostly christian druse eastern enclave and the christian western enclave  decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after israel s withdrawal  on may at pm  sla officers in the western sector received orders from the israelis to leave their posts as hizbollah was advancing towards their villages  thus the sla was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle  the main reason why the sla did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back  without access to medical and logistical supplies  our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border  from  w lc com special studies barakatjune htm the sla did collapse  what charbel barakat is talking about in the mef comments is that the remainder of the sla  christian  in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by israel  but it was only dismanted after most of the sla had collapsed  charbel barakat and other dead enders may have wanted  in theory anyway  to fight on in the west  but israel wasn t going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the sla going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border  the caution i would give about barakat and a couple others from the sla is that sometimes they think of their christian portion of the sla as if it were the entire sla  and from that point of view  the sla did not collapse and was dismantled by israel the biggest claim made by barakat is in weasel words it appeared that shiite officers were told by the israelis that they must leave it appeared that means he is guessing  nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the  shit es were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the nd  even barakat is unwilling to make that claim now lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn t know about with regard to the sla collapse  but the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the israeli government and army  nobody in the sla knows much of anything because if israel was going to collapse them  they would hardly tell them their plan  people  including me  can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened  but there are no facts to back any of those theories up  ,7de61d16c64579db,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

101445,48989,issues  well  i am very displeased with this article and with wikipedia for not wishing to ensure that all sides of the issue be reported on this sensitive topic the integrity of this article is only about a out of i too have added information to the introduction of this article lending mere existance to the fact that global warming is still disputed by some  and it too has dissappeared or was even removed by wikipedia i believe that enough discussion has occurred here  as per their request  to warrant that tiny tidbit of informaton being sited fairly in the introduction of this article  alongside the rant in the introduction that argues for global warming if wikipedia cannot do something so simple and fair and chooses to support silencing those whose views are contrary to their own  as a supposedly fair  balanced  and factual encyclopedia  i will have to boycott further use of this resource  because it s no resource when the information in it is purposefully skewed and where the encyclopedia takes actions that blatently support the skewing of information and the omission of facts wikipedia monitors this article has has repeatedly removed such additions that alter the single sided position of this article  for one my own addition therefore  wikipedia  i request once again that this information be added and it s evidence for that sited  without prejudice and without demeaning language  in this article  as this is only fair and factual my previous changes are on file and i would not mind them being replaced the controversary section isn t enough because it s language is clearly demeaning to any idea that does not support global warming and the introduction starts out stating it as a fact without lending weight to other views i don t have a problem with calling global warming a fact  i simply want it stated that it is a fact that many people still dissagree and have good evidence to support that idea just because al gore thinks we re headed for death doesn t make it so  as was pointed out in the last post here that just because a leader says that everyone agrees with him doesn t make it true i remind you that plenty of action groups  left wing radical groups and individuals  non existant scientists  and other disreputable groups and people have also supported global warming  and therefore  i want to state for the record that just because an oil tycoon signs against global warming doesn t mean everyone who does isn t credible you never hear about the s of thousands of scientists that dispute it  but that agrees with gw  he makes the front page anyway  i come down hardest on wikipedia because they re the host of this article and it is their responsibility to make sure its  integrity is maintained  and there they have failed in my opinion  borghuman  see wikipedia undue weight although i personally have no problem with mentioning that there are people willing to deny facts  it s on about the same level as ignoring claims of people who still believe the earth is flat  a mention would do no harm  however ,82f859594c41041e,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

30378,20783, i ve got to say  i ve read you pacafistic rules  seen your idea of logic and have heard tales of your justification and i just have to say i have this to say on my behavior  i m a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements  even when they are against my favor  i change subjects  help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong  ask them for proper information that i might use against them  basically anything a scatter brainer would do i let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out  i try to help both of us come out on top  i treat both equelly  and i don t get angry when someone yells in my face why should i  they are angry first so i know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them  sound fimiliar i give them their space though i would still do what i did do to annoy them  except  i do it without coming into contact with them  as they would do to me  which i know we d both appreciate i keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable  others can t resolve the problem  only make it bigger and more serious for either or both  see below if they ever try to apologize i tell them not to because i wouldn t because i have no reason to because we shouldn t have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it  conflict is stupid  almost  but not quite  as stupid as the species that create embrace it  leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve now  i have this to say about the good people of wikipedia  wow  there sure aren t a lot of you  i wonder why  you ve seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits  you  think  you know what to expect  well you have most of it down  but you went wrong at a few turns you  blindly  follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much  shit  they re full of you think you got human psychology in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane you don t want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with pov point of views  but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it you take sides in arguments between users based solely on what you think is most right based apon how you have been taught what is right  you are no one to interpret what mad kind eccentric ect  is  just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we d look and be exactly the same  and you don t want that and don t you tell me to calm down  i get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way  and it certainly isn t any diffen t with bots most importantly  you robots are full of  shit you take leaders favorites who take favorites who put up with your  shit  like its the right thing to do because they don t knowwhat else to do  sickening a  you abuse your power instead of embracing it s enlightenment  don t you get it he wasn t going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me  he knew i knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and  block  me himself  but he didn t  he wanted to add insult to injury you think people want to have someone powerful to look up to  no  they want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced in we all want what we shouldn t have unfortunately  there are some of us who already have what we shouldn t have how you go about it is the wrong way some things people must learn for themselves  you have a problem  try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve  if some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them butt out and leave them to their bickering  sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account or reasoning  or they may even just stop but if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit  things will get much worse i ll let you know whether you care or not you came in and took his side of the argument and banned me for hours  hoping that would teach me a lesson and make me think twice about wiki etiquette  but you must already know  before i just wanted him to stay off my talk page  now  i want to kill him for r,36dc9ecaa89aaf94,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,1.0,1

103783,157486,jesse ragan deletion nomination hi  i have received notice that the page i began about jesse ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article  first  i am not the man  assuming jesse ragan is male nor have i met him her  i began the article because as a professor of typography i felt ragan s work significant  and that s he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life  s he has been several time recognized by the american institute of graphic arts  aiga the national professional organization for graphic designers ragan s work has appeared in respected design periodicals  and has lectured on typography at several association of independent colleges of art and design  aicad  institutions  several days ago i noticed removal of ragan s name from credits for typefaces on the tobias frere jones article  my first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between ragan and his former employers hoefler frere jones  perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion  mr  hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that jesse ragan was only one of many who worked on the project  that may be the case  but that would not discredit typefaces ragan has produced entirely on his own  or the two mentions of his contributions to the archer typeface on the aiga web site  clearly  at some point someone at hoefler frere jones thought ragan s contributions significant enough to provide his her name  and not the rest of that team  to our national professional organization  the fact that mr  ms  ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this  but i have no knowledge of this  i know none of these people personally  and i respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest  my primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers  and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general  jesse ragan s work is very solid  even his her own direct client list is impressive  in the world of typography  apprentices are historically given credit  witness francesco griffo who apprenticed to aldus manutius  it is my hope that wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant ,df0e68ecd04e1db4,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

18032,117542, back me up on this one i intend to clean up the jihad article  i intend it to conform to npov standards  even though there are numerous povs about it  it is something very simple  a noun  an idea  and something there shouldn t be any argument about  i am worried about people reverting my edits which will be npov  simply because they want to  and can  i m not asking you to help me in potential votes  i do not approve of vote stacking and never ask people to vote for things  i intend to clean up the article in the next week or so  barring complications  all i ask is that you stop by some time in the next coupl a weeks and provide a voice of reason at some point in the inevitable objection to my edits  which may not be that huge but everyone is edge at that page thank you  p s  your story about avi moved me  i happen to be one of those bourgeoisie foreign palestinians who have never set foot there and should only open there mouths to support the palestinians who live there  anti arabism article salam based on what i have read about you  you seem to be very well respected among many wikipedians and you tend to have a relatively neutral point of view  so i m requesting that you review the latest additions  mainly mine  to the anti arabism article for any biases  also  are you still planning to amend the article  and what do you think about adding this image found here to the anti arabism in iran section it seems to demonstrate the views of anti arab persians very well  so its inclusion is important  however  i m not familiar with wikipedia s rules concerning uploading images  you would probably know more about this  what do you think a hint here s a hint  if your textbooks in grade schools didn t claim israel doesn t have a right to exist  if parents in your society weren t teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them virgins  if your government didn t name streets after mass murderers  pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers  put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes  and if your people weren t spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure  starting businesses  and building better lives  then there would be no need for checkpoints  no need for a big ass wall  no need for anything of the sort  and you d have your state  you d have had it decades ago if your goal was to have a state you could have been living freely  if the arab states had accepted the offer  signed a nonagression pact  and let you come home instead of stuffing your parents inside refugee camps cynically turning you into shock troops and poster children for oh look what the jew s did to  our people  when we stuffed them into refugee camps instead of taking the easy way to let them go home  you could have had a palestinian state in you could have had one at any time after that but it s as you say  on the last day  even the rocks and the trees will shout  o muslim  there is a jew  hiding behind me  come and kill him  your goal isn t a palestinian state  it s the death of my people and establishing a sharia state on top of their cooling bodies i just cleaned up some of your ridiculous lies on one page  i m not going to bother checking anywhere else yet  that would be wikistalking you will stop being pompous  you will stop being a racist  you will stop trying to push your astonishingly biased pov into articles  you will stop lying you will also stop trying to hide when someone calls you on your racist attitudes  ,73fd3cd755745fd4,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
29664,7186, i must quote what dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when i  trans late i use province of lower silesia etc  however  here on wikipedia  i have to go with decisions made long ago  the problem is that wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not  trans lators  they should be aware that in real life the use of voivodeship results in confusion  as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means  some polish people may not care about it because polish is a reader responsible language  so polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding  by contrast  english is a writer responsible language  i e  writers in english are responsible for making their texts understandable i wrote about the classification and some other problems related to  trans lation in my article  pages importantly  this is reflected in the wikipedia manual of style  as one of the five general principles of wikipedia is clarity  writing should be clear and concise  plain english works best  avoid jargon  and vague or unnecessarily complex wording  voivodeship is jargon  understandable nearly exclusively to polish people i started a similar discussion in wikipedia many years ago but i was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now it s too late  i wish i was more experienced then and knew that voivodeship is against the principles of wikipedia  ,1324761a883bcd3a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

57353,149680, you ll just have to forgive me if i take a timeout for a kafka moment  from before the law before the law stands a doorkeeper  to this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country and prays for admittance to the law  but the doorkeeper says that he cannot grant admittance at the moment  the man thinks it over and then asks if he will be allowed in later  it is possible  says the doorkeeper  but not at the moment  since the gate stands open  as usual  and the doorkeeper steps to one side  the man stoops to peer through the gateway into the interior  observing that  the doorkeeper laughs and says if you are so drawn to it just try to go in despite my veto  but take note  i am powerful  and i am only the least of the doorkeepers  from hall to hall there is one doorkeeper after another  each more powerful than the last  the third doorkeeper is already so terrible that even i cannot bear to look at him  these are difficulties the man from the country has not expected  the law  he thinks  should surely be accessible at all times and to everyone  but as he now takes a closer look at the doorkeeper in his fur coat  with his big sharp nose and long  thin  black tartar beard  he decides that it is better to wait until he gets permission to enter  the doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at one side of the door  there he sits for days and years  he makes many attempts to be admitted  and wearies the doorkeeper by his importunity  the doorkeeper frequently has little interviews with him  asking him questions about his home and many other things  but the questions are put indifferently  as great lords put them  and always finish with the statement that he cannot be let in yet  the man  who has furnished himself with many things for his journey  sacrifices all he has  however valuable  to bribe the doorkeeper  the doorkeeper accepts everything  but always with the remark i am only taking it to keep you from thinking you have omitted anything  during these many years the man fixes his attention almost continuously on the doorkeeper  he forgets the other doorkeepers  and this first one seems to him the sole obstacle preventing access to the law  he curses his bad luck  in his early years boldly and loudly  later  as he grows old  he only grumbles to himself  he becomes childish  and since in his yearlong contemplation of the doorkeeper he has come to know even the fleas in his fur collar  he begs the fleas as well to help him and to change the doorkeeper s mind  at length his eyesight begins to fail  and he does not know whether the world is really darker or whether his eyes are only deceiving him  yet in his darkness he is now aware of a radiance that streams inextinguishably from the gateway of the law  now he has not very long to live  before he dies  all his experiences in these long years gather themselves in his head to one point  a question he has not yet asked the doorkeeper  he waves him nearer  since he can no longer raise his stiffening body  the doorkeeper has to bend low toward him  for the difference in height between them has altered much to the man s disadvantage  what do you want to know now asks the doorkeeper you are insatiable  everyone strives to reach the law  says the man  so how does it happen that for all these many years no one but myself has ever begged for admittance the doorkeeper recognizes that the man has reached his end  and  to let his failing senses catch the words  roars in his ear no one else could ever be admitted here  since this gate was made only for you  i am now going to shut it  ,5fdb392e5f3cfcb7,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

29360,104715, i m currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario  and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to i don t think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a pnrs is caused by some intelligence  another pnrs is caused by intelligence  and to induce that the third pnrs is probably caused by some intelligence  there are unknown possible ways to generate a pnrs  and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples  this feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about years ago  back in the day  designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures  florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range  politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it s good for elections  so  they pressure the upper management of nasa to launch outside the designed safe range  this happened a number of time without problem  at some point  management decided that the designers were wrong  and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider  this continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold  if you shuffle a deck and pull or face cards in a row from the top of the deck  you can t really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be  it could be a deck of only face cards  it could be many full decks  it could be a stacked deck  probabilities can t be determined off of a few rolls of the dice  two cases showing the pnrs was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third pnrs  this is playing on a gut feeling that people have when they re playing roulette  casino s will post the last rolls  some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of pattern and bet based off of that  on the gut feeling that the roullette wheel has some bias  they may even win a few times  but the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random  so any patterns is purely coincidental  ,3032318d6d40562a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

43740,48693, reply to your request for help i have read your request for help on my talk page  although i normally prefer to answer a message on the page where it was posted  on this occasion it seems to me that it will be more helpful if the information i give you is on your talk page for future reference  so i am copying your message to here  and replying here  please note that we are from digital agency and stayfree india given us instruction to create the page for the stayfreewomenforindia and it is not for the promotion of the product but it is for the good cause of the women in  india i really don t know who on the stayfree page in the wiki the wiki user is promotion  we can send you the content for the approval it is genuine and original content for the periods how to cure on those days we would like to make awareness to women to use sanitary pads because it is very safe for the health  please let us know how we can add the content for women care in wiki if you need we can use the j j  official id for this page hope to get the positive answer from your end preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs clearly you are acting in good faith  attempting to serve a useful purpose in informing people of information that stands to benefit their health  unfortunately  however  this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which wikipedia does not do  and it conflicts with several of wikipedia s policies and guidelines  you are clearly intending to use wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it  whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or for the good cause of the women in india is irrelevant  wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose  to put the same thing another way  the policy that wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests  trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do  but it is not one of the things that wikipedia does you should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with wikipedia s conflict of interest guidelines  a wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view  and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with  it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view in fact  in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view  since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing  stayfree india has used several wikipedia accounts  which have been  block  from editing  because their only purpose was using wikipedia to promote their cause  they have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf  to continue the attempt to promote their cause  under wikipedia s policy on  abuse of multiple accounts  if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a  block  editor  thereby helping the  block  editor to evade the block  the account used for such purposes can be  block  too  as it is being used to circumvent wikipedia s policies  as i said at the beginning of this message  i have no doubt that you are acting in good faith  and that is why i have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are  rather than simply blocking your account  you are welcome to contribute to wikipedia on other topics  where you do not have a conflict of interest  would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts  and would not be promoting a cause  however  continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with wikipedia s policies in those respects will not be acceptable  ,823105015ed9064c,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

50972,32491, this info is all messed up pit bull is a slang term that describes several types of dogs with similar physical characteristics  there are several physically similar breeds that are often termed pit bull including the american pit bull terrier  american staffordshire terrier  the staffordshire bull terrier  the bull terrier  the perro de presa canario  cane corso  and argentine dogos these breeds are usually not included by name in any breed specific legislation  see below but are sometimes included because of a broad definition and confusion as to what a pit bull actually is all of these breeds as well as many others  including great danes  newfoundlands and rottweilers  are members of the molosser family of dog breeds pitbull is not a slang its just one of the nicknames och shortened names the breed has had during the years  those that use it for dogs other then pitbulls are just ignorant and dont have the facts surrounding the breed clear to them  often used by journalists and people without any background info its a pure breed dog registered under ukc since its beeing registered under american pitbull terrier under a few more registrys such as adba bfkc in usa i dont know why this site  that is set to be some kind of kowledge base allows itself to have this info at the top of the page  all it does  is to confuse people that come in here to read and to find out more about the breed if this is the first thing a visitor reads then it often sticks to his her mind as truth and he leaves the site  if a reader comes in here to search facts because he her is unsure about what a pitbull is because of medias coverage  then this info just confirmes to him her that there is no such thing as a real pitbull  with is as far from the truth you may come  there are so many myths and hearsays around this breed so i suggest the top info to be rewritten and only contain facts many countries have their own kennelclubs and they are all tied together by fci as an international organ  but fci only works with kennelclub per country and if a dog aint listed in that club other countries follow fci regulations and do the same  this is why fci dossent recognize the pitbull as a pure breed  they work with akc  american kennel club  that dossent keep register of the pitbull but the american staffordshire terrier  pitbulls as i said erlier was first registered with ukc  united kennel club  and because only one club per country is allowed in fic regulations the pitbull was left outside due to a tecnicality this is the same in several countries  the national kennelclubs is tied to follow fci regulations if they are members and thats why sweden for example dossent recognize the pitbull in their own kennel klub  skk why did i say all this then well it goes back to what i wrote erlier  if a person think that pitbull just is a slang and not a pure breed as written at top of wikipedia site about pitbulls and lives in sweden for example then this sites info add more to the myths so if a moderator reads this please think hard about what signals the top text about pitbulls sends out to this pages viewers  niklas sweden ,566d398508d3773e,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

51588,6994, to cool hand luke  i ask for your help as an administrator with this problem  from the wikipedia deletion guidelines deletion process main article  wikipedia deletion policy  deletion of articles from wikipedia occurs through one of three processes another quick method is the use of proposed deletion  simply add to the top of the article  this is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial  yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion  a proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the  tag within five days  and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full afd process is required i thought i complied with this policy  it seems to say that any user can contest the proposal by removing the tag  it seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion  beyond meeting the criteri ass pecifics  the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it i believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of wikipedia  and that the proposal to delete  along with the reasons given  which i believe are not in good faith  therefore violates various wikipedia policies the evidence for this belief includes the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion the user s prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of  as demonstrated by his reasons or comments  to the subject of the article proposed for deletion the fact that i have worked on this article in the past the fact that this user on or about the same day and time  in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me  proposed two other articles that i have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before i or anyone else had a chance to object  wikipedia is not a full time job for most users  who only visit the site from time to time  and note also the stated policy that there are no emergencies on wikipedia  the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass  redirected the article to another article  effectively deleting the original article  in fact the redirect was effect as i was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay  and when i hit save  the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost he gave me three rapid succession warnings  in bad faith  for what i believe were good faith acts on my part  and had me  block  before i could make a response to his warnings it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users it seems quite clear in light of the above  and further facts that can be marshalled in support  that this user s intent is not supported by facts or policies not in good faith in retaliation  and therefore in violation of wikipedia policy recognizing this  i communicated to this user that i would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement  by not making any further comment on the talk page of tort reform  i had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not  as the user had made the dispute personal as for my being  block  by you as per the revert rule  i must point out that i do not believe the rule applies to what i did  because i was making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a user s  his  apparent violations rather than reply  he deleted the warnings and requests to stop did so more than three times  in violation of the rule in bad faith  turned the rule on mei did not delete anything  and technically  i did not revert anything either  i think  but was adding to previous posts  and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a new post other indications of bad faith the user asserts that i committed vandalism to the entry on sonic s rendezvous band by removing the delete tags  my reply is i did so in accordance with policy it is not vandalism to remove,12a39a1f3df7e13f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
